There have been worse languages, but not many.  Advantages of C++: Good libraries Disadvantages of C++: A type system that is too wimpy to express anything interesting, so that typical code is riddled with type casts, but that nevertheless has undecidable type checking. This is in stark contrast to O'Caml, Haskell, and SML. Even Java does this better.  No type inference at all, so all variable types must be declared.  Horrid syntax  To go with the horrid syntax, an ancient, primitive macro system that is 1) hard to understand 2) non-hygienic, and 3) incapable of complex computations. For a proper macro system, see Scheme's syntax-case macro system.           yasar  2012-08-11 16:42:40 UTC   #4    thnx for the replies guys and those links really helped i thought about it again and the answer has been accepted           jbits24  2013-01-19 09:15:25 UTC   #5    whats the problem with this code:  include  int main() { int n; while(scanf("%d", &n) && n!=42) printf("%d\n", n); printf("%d", n); return 0; }           navneetsinha_sof  2013-01-19 20:26:57 UTC   #6    you are missing one condition read the problem again. Happy coding           kv05  2014-05-21 15:38:02 UTC   #7    Hi, i am not able to find the error in my program. My code is as follows: public class Life { int inputArray[]; Life(int a[]){ inputArray=a; }  void printResult(){
	System.out.println("Started");
	//System.out.println(inputArray[0]);
	for(int i=0;i<=inputArray.length-1;i++){
		if(inputArray[i]==42 &&(inputArray[i]>99)&&(inputArray[i]<-99))
			break;
		System.out.println(inputArray[i]);
	}
	System.out.println("FINISHED");
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
	int c[]={1,3,4,5,1,2,3,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,42,4,5,6,7,8,4};
	Life ob=new Life(c);
	ob.printResult();
	}
}           kv05  2014-05-21 15:38:44 UTC   #8    And i have changed Life to Main           leppyr64  2014-05-21 19:49:29 UTC   #9    Welcome! Please use code tags when posting code.  What language is this?  What error is the judge returning?           kv05  2014-05-22 04:01:11 UTC   #10    [quote="leppy"]Hello leppy... This is Java.. I am new to programming world and I don't know about code tags.. Can you figure out the issue?  Thanks for your response.           luckymastermin  2014-05-22 04:13:06 UTC   #11    Your code should look like this. click on code tag and paste your code between them. and on SPOJ you should not use public before class if you are using public you class name should be main.  Your algorithm is completely wrong, what problem is asking is you have to print all number until you encounter 42 in the input. Input can be any integer value it is not only between 1 and 100,and no need to print Started or finished in the output you have to print only those things which problem is asking for.  Hope this helps.  class Life 
{
	int inputArray[];
	Life(int a[])
	{
		inputArray=a;
	}
	void printResult()
	{
		System.out.println("Started");
		//System.out.println(inputArray[0]);
		for(int i=0;i<=inputArray.length-1;i++)
		{
			if(inputArray[i]==42 &&(inputArray[i]>99)&&(inputArray[i]<-99))

Read the problem statement once again.           kv05  2014-05-22 05:15:38 UTC   #16      lakshmankuma:  I am initializing array c with these values           kv05  2014-05-22 05:18:50 UTC   #17      lakshmankuma:  And then passing the reference of this array c to the constructor. It is not printing anything because the first element is 42. If you want to test the other test cases you can check those. Anyways I have checked this on my system and each of the test cases is getting passed.           luckymastermin  2014-05-22 05:19:35 UTC   #18    Still you don't understand what problem is asking for. answer my question.-->How you are reading the input?           kv05  2014-05-22 05:21:28 UTC   #19    array c is my input           kv05  2014-05-22 05:22:10 UTC   #20    i am nt taking inputs from console.         next page â†’      Home  Categories  FAQ/Guidelines  Terms of Service  Privacy Policy      Powered by Discourse , best viewed with JavaScript enabled
