Your task is to find the area which is common to all the squares (Area of intersection of all the squares)  Input  First line contain T the number of test cases. then t test cases follow. First line of each test case contains N, the number of squares Each of following N line contains 3 integer (X, Y, L) cordinate of lower left vertex and size of the square. First line contain T the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. First line of each test case contains N, the number of squares Each of following N line contains 3 integer (X, Y, L) cordinate of lower left vertex and size of the square.  -10^9<=X,Y<=10^9    1<=L<=10^9         gajalchouhan : 2017-07-02 15:22:01   this test case is wrong. if you put the input 1,2,88,42 output will get 1,2,88 this is the right answer if u put a input  like this..
