Bear and Colors time limit per test 2 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output Bear Limak has n colored balls, arranged in one long row. Balls are numbered 1 through n , from left to right. There are n possible colors, also numbered 1 through n . The i -th ball has color t i . For a fixed interval (set of consecutive elements) of balls we can define a dominant color. It's a color occurring the biggest number of times in the interval. In case of a tie between some colors, the one with the smallest number (index) is chosen as dominant. There are non-empty intervals in total. For each color, your task is to count the number of intervals in which this color is dominant. Input The first line of the input contains a single integer n ( 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 ) — the number of balls. The second line contains n integers t 1 , t 2 , ..., t n ( 1 ≤ t i ≤ n ) where t i is the color of the i -th ball. Output Print n integers. The i -th of them should be equal to the number of intervals where i is a dominant color. Examples Input 4 1 2 1 2 Output 7 3 0 0 Input 3 1 1 1 Output 6 0 0 Note In the first sample, color 2 is dominant in three intervals:  An interval [2, 2] contains one ball. This ball's color is 2 so it's clearly a dominant color. An interval [4, 4] contains one ball, with color 2 again. An interval [2, 4] contains two balls of color 2 and one ball of color 1 . There are 7 more intervals and color 1 is dominant in all of them.
