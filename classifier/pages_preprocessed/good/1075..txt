Thread in a Space Time limit: 1.0 second Memory limit: 64 MB There are three points in a 3-dimensional space: A , B and C . All the coordinates of the points are integer numbers with absolute values not greater than 1000. A solid ball with a center in the point C is firmly fixed. A radius of the ball is R , a positive integer number. Distances from the point C to the points A and B are strictly greater than R . It is necessary to stretch a thread of minimal length between points A and B . Surely, the thread should be outside of the ball. You are to find out a length of the thread. Input The first three lines contain coordinates of the points A , B and C respectively. The fourth one contains a radius R of the ball. Output should contain a minimal length of the thread to within 2 symbols after a decimal point. You should output answer with two or more digits. Sample input output 0 0 12
