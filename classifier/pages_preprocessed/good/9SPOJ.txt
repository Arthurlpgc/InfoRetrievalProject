There are two types of operations and they are defined as follows: Update: This will be indicated in the input by a 'U' followed by space and then two integers i and x.  U i x , 1 ≤ i ≤ N, and x, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^8. This operation sets the value of A[i] to x.  Query:  This will be indicated in the input by a 'Q' followed by a single space and then two integers i and j.  Q x y , 1 ≤ x < y ≤ N. You must find i and j such that x ≤ i, j ≤ y and i != j, such that the sum A[i]+A[j] is maximized. Print the sum A[i]+A[j].  Input  The first line of input consists of an integer N representing the length of the sequence. Next
line consists of N space separated integers A[i]. Next line contains an integer Q , Q ≤ 10^5, representing the number of operations. Next Q lines contain the operations. Output  Output the maximum sum mentioned above, in a separate line, for each Query. Example   Input: 5
