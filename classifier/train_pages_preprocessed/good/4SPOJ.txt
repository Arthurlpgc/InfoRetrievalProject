Calculate the total area that these N circles cover.  Input  First line: N (1 <= n <= 50)  - In the i-th line of the next n lines contains 3 integers Xi, Yi and Ri, separated by spaces. These are the coordinates of the center and the radius of the i-th circle (-10000<=Yi-Ri,Yi+Ri,Xi-Ri,Xi+Ri<=10000)  Output  The total area that these N circles cover with 5 digits after decimal point  Example   Input: 2
