CCC '11 J3 - Sumac Sequences View as PDF       Submit solution   All submissions   Best submissions    Points: 5   Time limit: 2.0s     Memory limit: 64M      Problem type  Simple Math      Canadian Computing Competition: 2011 Stage 1, Junior #3  In a sumac sequence,     t  1   ,   t  2   ,  …  ,   t  m    t_1, t_2, \dots, t_m   , each term is an integer greater than or equal   0  0   . Also, each term, starting with the third, is the difference of the preceding two terms (that is,     t   n  +  2    =   t  n   −   t   n  +  1     t_{n+2} = t_n - t_{n+1}   for    n  ≥  1   n \ge 1   ). The sequence terminates at    t  m   t_m   if     t   m  −  1    <   t  m    t_{m-1} < t_m   .  For example, if we have   120  120   and   71  71   , then the sumac sequence generated is as follows:     120  ,  71  ,  49  ,  22  ,  27.   \displaystyle 120, 71, 49, 22, 27.    This is a sumac sequence of length   5  5   .  Input Specification  The input will be two positive numbers    t  1   t_1   and    t  2   t_2   , with    0  <   t  2   <   t  1   <  10   000   0 < t_2 < t_1 < 10\,000   .  Output Specification  The output will be the length of the sumac sequence given by the starting numbers    t  1   t_1   and    t  2   t_2   .  Sample Input  120
