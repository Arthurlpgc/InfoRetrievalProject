                    <p>
	You were invited to do a little job for your Mathematic teacher. The job is to read a Mathematic expression in format of two rational numbers (numerator / denominator) and present the result of the operation. Each operand or operator is separated by a blank space. The input sequence (each line) must respect the following format: number, (‘/’ char), number, operation char (‘/’, ‘*’, ‘+’, ‘-‘), number, (‘/’ char), number. The answer must be presented followed by ‘=’ operator and the simplified answer. If the answer can’t be simplified, it must be repeated after a ‘=’ operator. </p>
    <p>	
	Considering N1 and D1 as numerator and denominator of the first fraction, follow the orientation about how to do each one of these 4 operations:</p>
    <p>
	Sum: (N1*D2 + N2*D1) / (D1*D2)<br />
	Subtraction: (N1*D2 - N2*D1) / (D1*D2)<br />
	Multiplication: (N1*N2) / (D1*D2)<br />
	Division: (N1/D1) / (N2/D2), that means (N1*D2)/(N2*D1)</p>

                </div>

                <h2>Input</h2>

                <div class="input">
                    <p>
					The input contains several cases of test. The first value is an integer <strong>N </strong>(1 ≤ <strong>N </strong>≤ 1*10<sup>4</sup>), indicating the amount of cases of test that must be read. Each case of test contains a rational value <strong>X </strong>(1 ≤ <strong>X </strong>≤ 1000), an operation (-, +, * or /) and another rational value <strong>Y </strong>(1 ≤ <strong>Y </strong>≤ 1000).<br /> </p>

                </div>

                <h2>Output</h2>

                <div class="output">
                    <p>
						The output must be a rational number, followed by a “=“ sign and another rational number, that is the simplification of the first value. In case of the first value can’t be simplified, the same value must be repeated after the ‘=’ sign.<br />
