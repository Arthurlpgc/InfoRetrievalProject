                    <p>
	Felipinho is thrilled with his new RPG game, about wars between clans of vampires. In this game he plays a vampire that repeatedly comes into combat against vampires from other clans. Such battles are won or lost based on some characteristics of the opponents, with the help of a standard six-faced dice. For simplicity, we will consider only the fight between two vampires, Vampire 1 and Vampire 2. Each vampire has a vital energy (denoted respectively by <i>EV<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>EV<sub>2</sub></i>). Besides, an attack force <i>AT</i> and a damage capacity <i>D</i> are also given.</p>
<p>
	The combat is fought in turns, in the following way. At each turn, the dice is rolled; if the result value is less than or equal to <strong><i>AT</i></strong>, Vampire 1 wins the turn, otherwise Vampire 2 wins. The winner then sucks the value <strong><i>D</i> </strong>from the loser\'s vital energy. That is, <strong><i>D</i> </strong>points are subtracted from the loser's vital energy and added to the winner's vital energy. The combat continues until one of the fighters has <strong><i>EV</i> </strong>less than or equal to zero.</p>
<p>
	For example, suppose <i><strong>EV<sub>1</sub></strong>=7</i>,<strong> </strong><i><strong>EV<sub>2</sub></strong>=5</i>, <i><strong>AT</strong>=2</i> and<strong> </strong><i><strong>D</strong>=4</i>. The dice is rolled and the result value is <i>3</i>. Then, Vampire 2 wins the turn, and therefore <i>4</i> points are subtracted from <strong><i>EV<sub>1</sub></i> </strong>and added to <strong><i>EV<sub>2</sub></i></strong>. The new values for the vital energies would be <i><strong>EV<sub>1</sub></strong>=3</i> and <i><strong>EV<sub>2</sub></strong>=9</i>. Notice that, if in the next turn Vampire 2 wins again, the combat ends. The values of <i><strong>AT</strong></i> and <i><strong>D</strong></i> are constant throughout the combat; only <strong><i>EV<sub>1</sub></i> </strong>and <strong><i>EV<sub>2</sub></i> </strong>vary.</p>
<p>
	Despite loving the game, Felipinho thinks that the combats are too long, and suspects that, given the initial values of <strong><i>EV<sub>1</sub></i></strong>, <strong><i>EV<sub>2</sub></i></strong>, <strong><i>AT</i> </strong>and <strong><i>D</i></strong>, it is possible to determine the probability of one of the players winning the combat, and that could help shorten the combat time. Felipinho has asked your help to verify his suspicion.</p>

                <h2>Input</h2>

                <div class="input">
                    <p>
	The input contains several test cases. Each test case is given in one single line, containing four integers <strong><i>EV<sub>1</sub></i></strong>, <strong><i>EV<sub>2</sub></i></strong>, <strong><i>AT</i> </strong>and <strong><i>D</i> </strong>separated by spaces (<i>1 ≤ <strong>EV<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>EV<sub>2</sub> </strong>≤ 10</i>, <i>1 ≤ <strong>AT </strong>≤ 5</i> and <i>1 ≤ <strong>D </strong>≤ 10</i>). The end of input is indicated by one line containing only four zeros, separated by spaces.</p>

                <div class="output">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
	For each test case in the input, your program must print a single line. The line must contain a real number representing, in terms of percentages, the probability that Vampire 1 wins the combat. The result must be printed as a real number with exactly one decimal figure.</p>
