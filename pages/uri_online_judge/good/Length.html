                    Create a program to sort a set of strings by their size. Its program is to receive a set of 
                    strings and return by this same size ordered set of words, if the size of the strings are equal, 
                    must maintain the original order of the set.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Input</h2>

            <div class="input">
                <p>
                    The first line of input has a unique integer N that indicates the number of sets of strings, 
                    each set may contain between 1 and 50 inclusive elements, and each of the strings of the set 
                    may contain between 1 and 50 inclusive characters.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Output</h2>

            <div class="output">
                <p>
                    The output should contain the set of input strings ordered by the length of strings.A blank space must be printed between two words.</p>
