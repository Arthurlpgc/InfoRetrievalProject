Each contest will have three problems, one each of easy, medium and hard levels.\n \nNow, after some time, Malvika realized that creating hard problems for a contest is not as easy for her as solving them. So she asked her friend Animesh to join the team and help her with it. Animesh himself is no good with creating problems, but he suggested her a clever strategy to reduce the number of hard problems she needs to create. He suggested that ACM-ICPC could have three types of contests, comprising of the following problem levels:\n \n Type 1: 1 easy, 1 medium, 1 hard \n Type 2: 1 easy, 2 medium \n Type 3: 2 easy, 1 medium \n \n \nOne day, Malvika and Animesh sat down and prepared  e  easy problems,  m  medium, and  h  hard problems. As we know that it is harder to make higher difficulty problems, the number of hard problems will be no more than medium and similarly, the number of medium level problems, will be no more than easy level.\n \nNow, they want to use the above problems to organizes a series of contests. Also, as they want the series to be interesting, so they don't want to have two consecutive contests in the series to be of the same type.\n \nCan you please help them in finding out the maximum number of contests they can conduct in the series?\n \n In the first example , they have 1 easy, 1 medium and 1 hard problem. They can conduct one contest of type 1. This is the maximum number of contests they can conduct.\n In the second example , they have 4 easy, 4 medium, and 4 hard problems. They can conduct 3 contests, one each of type 1, 2, and 3, which require a total of 4 easy, 4 med and 1 hard problems. This is the maximum number of contests they can conduct. Hence, the answer is 3.\n    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
