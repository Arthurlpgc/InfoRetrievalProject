Pizza Separation time limit per test 1 second memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output Students Vasya and Petya are studying at the BSU (Byteland State University). At one of the breaks they decided to order a pizza. In this problem pizza is a circle of some radius. The pizza was delivered already cut into  n  pieces. The  i -th piece is a sector of angle equal to  a i . Vasya and Petya want to divide all pieces of pizza into two  continuous  sectors in such way that the difference between angles of these sectors is minimal. Sector angle is sum of angles of all pieces in it. Pay attention, that one of sectors can be empty.

Output Print one integer \u00a0\u2014 the minimal difference between angles of sectors that will go to Vasya and Petya. Examples Input 4 90 90 90 90 Output 0 Input 3 100 100 160 Output 40 Input 1 360 Output 360 Input 4 170 30 150 10 Output 0 Note In first sample Vasya can take  1  and  2  pieces, Petya can take  3  and  4  pieces. Then the answer is  |(90\u2009+\u200990)\u2009-\u2009(90\u2009+\u200990)|\u2009=\u20090 . In third sample there is only one piece of pizza that can be taken by only one from Vasya and Petya. So the answer is  |360\u2009-\u20090|\u2009=\u2009360 . In fourth sample Vasya can take  1  and  4  pieces, then Petya will take  2  and  3  pieces. So the answer is  |(170\u2009+\u200910)\u2009-\u2009(30\u2009+\u2009150)|\u2009=\u20090 . Picture explaning fourth sample: Both red and green sectors consist of two adjacent pieces of pizza. So Vasya can take green sector, then Petya will take red sector."}
