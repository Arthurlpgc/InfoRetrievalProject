Each employee, except the director, has a supervisor. The director doesn't have a supervisor. Let's call employee  v , an ancestor of employee  u  if and only if  v  is the supervisor of  u  or  v  is an ancestor of the supervisor of  u . Also, each employee belongs to exactly one club. Employee  i  belongs to club number  C i . And each club has some internal levels, which are actually independent of the company hierarchy. Each member of a club has a Level Number. The Level Number of employee  i  is denoted by  K i . The higher the Level Number, the more important he is in the club. Each club wants to advertise, and for that, they want to claim that people who are more important in their club, end up being superior in the company. So they want to find such instances. More precisely, for every employee  v , a sequence of company employees ( e 1 , e 2 , ..., e q ) is a  good  sequence starting at  v , if all of these conditions hold true:\n \n e 1  = v .\n All of them are part of the same club. \n e i  is an ancestor of  e i+1 , for i = 1 to q - 1. \n K [ e 1 ] = q - 1,  K [ e 2 ] = q - 2, ...,  K [ e q ] = 0. \n \n  For each employee  v , you want to find the total number of  good  sequences starting with it. As these numbers could be very large, output the answers modulo 10 9 +7. \n \n The first line of the input contains an integer  T , denoting the number of test cases. The description of each testcase follows.\n The first line of each test case contains two integers,  N  and  X , denoting the number of employees in the company and a bound on the size of the Level Numbers, as mentioned in the Constraints section below. \n The second line contains  N - 1  space-separated integers:  P 1 ,  P 2 , ...,  P N - 1 , denoting the supervisors.  P i  is the supervisor of employee  i . \n The third line contains  N  space-separated integers:  C 0 ,  C 1 , ...,  C N - 1 , denoting the clubs.  C i  is the club that employee  i  belongs to. \n The fourth line contains  N  space-separated integers:  K 0 ,  K 1 , ...,  K N - 1 , denoting the Level Numbers.  K i  is the Level number of employee  i . \n \n For each test case, you have to output  N  lines. Line number  i + 1  should contain the answer for employee  i . \n Subtask #1  (20 points): \n \n Sum of integers in the output of all testcases \u2264  20000 , and  \n Sum of  N  over all test cases \u2264  5000 \n \n \n Subtask #2  (30 points):\n \n N  \u2264  5000 , and \n Sum of  N  over all test cases \u2264  20000 \n \n \n Subtask #3  (25 points): \n \n N  \u2264  100000 , and  \n Sum of  N  over all test cases \u2264  500000 \n \n \n Subtask #4  (25 points):\n \n Original constraints \n \n    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
