Automatic Door time limit per test 1 second memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output There is an automatic door at the entrance of a factory. The door works in the following way:    when one or several people come to the door and it is closed, the door immediately opens automatically and all people immediately come inside,   when one or several people come to the door and it is open, all people immediately come inside,   opened door immediately closes in  d  seconds after its opening,   if the door is closing and one or several people are coming to the door at the same moment, then all of them will have enough time to enter and only after that the door will close.  For example, if  d \u2009=\u20093  and four people are coming at four different moments of time  t 1 \u2009=\u20094 ,  t 2 \u2009=\u20097 ,  t 3 \u2009=\u20099  and  t 4 \u2009=\u200913  then the door will open three times: at moments  4 ,  9  and  13 .
