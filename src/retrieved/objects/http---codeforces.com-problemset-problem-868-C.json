Output Print \" YES \" (quotes for clarity), if it is possible to make an interesting problemset, and \" NO \" otherwise. You can print each character either upper- or lowercase (\" YeS \" and \" yes \" are valid when the answer is \" YES \"). Examples Input 5 3 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 Output NO Input 3 2 1 0 1 1 0 1 Output YES Note In the first example you can't make any interesting problemset, because the first team knows all problems. In the second example you can choose the first and the third problems. C.
