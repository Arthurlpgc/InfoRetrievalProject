He wants to make them completely identical, to achieve this goal, he can perform the following actions in a single move: \n \n Choose one of the matrices, either  A  or  B . \n Choose either one row or one column of the selected matrix. \n Increment all the numbers in the selected row or column by  1 . \n \n Now Chef is wondering, what is the minimal number of moves he has to perform in order to make matrices  A  and  B  equal? Or is it just impossible? The first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line of input contains two integers  n  and  m .  The following  n  lines contain  m  space separated integers each \u2015 the matrix  A .  The next  n  lines contain  m  space separated integers each \u2015 the matrix  B .  Warning!  The size of the input file can be up to  10 MB !        Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
