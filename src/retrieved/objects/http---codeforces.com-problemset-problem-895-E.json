Eyes Closed time limit per test 2.5 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output Vasya and Petya were tired of studying so they decided to play a game. Before the game begins Vasya looks at array  a  consisting of  n  integers. As soon as he remembers all elements of  a  the game begins. Vasya closes his eyes and Petya does  q  actions of one of two types: 1)  Petya says 4 integers  l 1,\u2009 r 1,\u2009 l 2,\u2009 r 2 \u00a0\u2014 boundaries of two non-intersecting segments. After that he swaps one random element from the  [ l 1,\u2009 r 1]  segment with another random element from the  [ l 2,\u2009 r 2]  segment. 2)  Petya asks Vasya the sum of the elements of  a  in the  [ l ,\u2009 r ]  segment. Vasya is a mathematician so he answers Petya the mathematical expectation of the sum of the elements in the segment. Your task is to write a program which will answer the second type questions as Vasya would do it. In other words your program should print the mathematical expectation of the sum of the elements of  a  in the  [ l ,\u2009 r ]  segment for every second type query.

Before the game begins Vasya looks at array  a  consisting of  n  integers. As soon as he remembers all elements of  a  the game begins. Vasya closes his eyes and Petya does  q  actions of one of two types: 1)  Petya says 4 integers  l 1,\u2009 r 1,\u2009 l 2,\u2009 r 2 \u00a0\u2014 boundaries of two non-intersecting segments. After that he swaps one random element from the  [ l 1,\u2009 r 1]  segment with another random element from the  [ l 2,\u2009 r 2]  segment. 2)  Petya asks Vasya the sum of the elements of  a  in the  [ l ,\u2009 r ]  segment. Vasya is a mathematician so he answers Petya the mathematical expectation of the sum of the elements in the segment.

Eyes Closed time limit per test 2.5 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output Vasya and Petya were tired of studying so they decided to play a game. Before the game begins Vasya looks at array  a  consisting of  n  integers. As soon as he remembers all elements of  a  the game begins. Vasya closes his eyes and Petya does  q  actions of one of two types: 1)  Petya says 4 integers  l 1,\u2009 r 1,\u2009 l 2,\u2009 r 2 \u00a0\u2014 boundaries of two non-intersecting segments. After that he swaps one random element from the  [ l 1,\u2009 r 1]  segment with another random element from the  [ l 2,\u2009 r 2]  segment. 2)  Petya asks Vasya the sum of the elements of  a  in the  [ l ,\u2009 r ]  segment. Vasya is a mathematician so he answers Petya the mathematical expectation of the sum of the elements in the segment. Your task is to write a program which will answer the second type questions as Vasya would do it. In other words your program should print the mathematical expectation of the sum of the elements of  a  in the  [ l ,\u2009 r ]  segment for every second type query.
