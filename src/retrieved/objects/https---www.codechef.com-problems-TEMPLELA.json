There are multiple strips of land that they are looking at, but not all of them are suitable. They need the strip of land to resemble a coiled Cobra. You need to find out which strips do so. Formally, every strip of land, has a length. Suppose the length of the i-th strip is is  N i , then there will be  N i  integers,  H i1 , H i2 , .. H iN i , which represent the heights of the ground at various parts of the strip, in sequential order. That is, the strip has been divided into  N i  parts and the height of each part is given. This strip is valid, if and only if all these conditions are satisfied: Your job is to look at every strip and find if it's valid or not. In the first strip, all the conditions are satisfied, hence it is valid. In the second strip, it does not start with a 1, and hence is invalid. In the third strip, it keeps increasing even past the centre, instead of decreasing. Hence invalid. The fourth strip does not increase and decrease by exactly 1. Hence invalid. The fifth satisfies all conditions and hence is valid. The sixth and seventh strip do not have a 'centre' part. Because for every part, there are either more parts to its right than its left, or more parts on its left than its right. Hence both the strips are invalid.     Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
