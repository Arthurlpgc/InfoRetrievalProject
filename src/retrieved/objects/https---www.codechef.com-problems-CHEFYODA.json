Yoda is a very busy cook and he doesn't want to spend time with losers. So he challenges the Chef to a series of games, and agrees to teach the Chef if Chef can win at least  P  of the games. The total number of games is  K . The games will be played on a chessboard of size  N * M . That is, it has  N  rows, each of which has  M  squares. At the beginning of the game, a coin is on square (1, 1), which corresponds to the top-left corner, and every other square is empty. At every step, Yoda and Chef have to move the coin on the chessboard. The player who cannot make a move loses. Chef makes the first move. They can't move the coin to a square where it had been placed sometime before in the game, and they can't move outside chessboard. \n \nIn this game, there are two different sets of rules according to which the game can be played: \n-from (x, y) player can move coin to (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1) in his turn, if they are valid squares. \n-from (x, y) player can move coin to (x+1, y+1), (x-1, y-1), (x-1, y+1), (x+1, y-1) in his turn, if they are valid squares. \n \nBefore every game, the Power of the kitchen chooses one among the two sets of rules with equal probability of  0.5 , and the game will be played according to those rules. Chef and Yoda are very wise, therefore they play optimally. You have to calculate the probability that Yoda will teach Chef. \n   \nInput begins with an integer  T , the number of test cases \nEach test case begins with 4 integers  N ,  M ,  P ,  K .\n \nFor each test case, output a line containing the answer for task. The output must have an absolute error at most 0.000001 (10 -6 ).  \n      Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
