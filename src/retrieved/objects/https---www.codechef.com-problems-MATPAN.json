Unfortunately, the text was not a\n   pangram . Now, Mathison has a particular liking for holoalphabetic strings and the text bothers him. The good news is that Mathison can buy letters from the local store in order to turn his text into a pangram.\n \n  However, each letter has a price and Mathison is not very rich. Can you help Mathison find the cheapest way to obtain a pangram?\n The first line of the input file will contain one integer,  T , representing the number of tests. Each test will be formed from two lines. The first one contains  26  space-separated integers, representing the prices of all letters.\n  The second will contain Mathison's initial text (a string of  N  lowercase letters).\n The output file will contain  T  lines, one for each test. Each line will contain the answer for the corresponding test.

After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
