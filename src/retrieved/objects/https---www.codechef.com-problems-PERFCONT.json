Predicting difficulty levels of the problems can be a daunting task. Chef wants his contests to be balanced in terms of difficulty levels of the problems. Assume a contest had total  P  participants. A problem that was solved by at least half of the participants (i.e.  P / 2  (integer division)) is said to be cakewalk difficulty. A problem solved by at max  P / 10  (integer division) participants is categorized to be a hard difficulty. Chef wants the contest to be balanced. According to him, a balanced contest must have exactly 1 cakewalk and exactly 2 hard problems. You are given the description of  N  problems and the number of participants solving those problems. Can you tell whether the contest was balanced or not? The first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers,  N, P  denoting the number of problems, number of participants respectively. The second line contains  N  space separated integers,  i -th of which denotes number of participants solving the  i -th problem. For each test case, output \"yes\" or \"no\" (without quotes) denoting whether the contest is balanced or not. Example case 1. : The problems are of hard, hard and cakewalk difficulty. There is 1 cakewalk and 2 hard problems, so the contest is balanced. Example case 2. : The second problem is hard and the third is cakewalk. There is 1 cakewalk and 1 hard problem, so the contest is not balanced. Example case 3. : All the three problems are hard. So the contest is not balanced. Example case 4. : The problems are of hard, hard, cakewalk difficulty. The contest is balanced. Example case 5. : All the problems are cakewalk. The contest is not balanced. Example case 6. : All the problems are hard. The contest is not balanced.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
