More precisely, for every  i  in range  [ l ,\u2009 r ] , if  a i  is strictly more than  x ,  a i  becomes equal  a i \u2009-\u2009 x . Operation 2:  2  l   r   x Willem asks Chtholly to count the number of cakes in the range  [ l ,\u2009 r ]  that needs to be cooked for exactly  x  seconds. More formally you should find number of such  i  in range  [ l ,\u2009 r ] , that  a i \u2009=\u2009 x .
