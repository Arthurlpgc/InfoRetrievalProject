Borya's Diagnosis time limit per test 2 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output It seems that Borya is seriously sick. He is going visit  n  doctors to find out the exact diagnosis. Each of the doctors needs the information about all previous visits, so Borya has to visit them in the prescribed order (i.e. Borya should first visit doctor  1 , then doctor  2 , then doctor  3  and so on).
