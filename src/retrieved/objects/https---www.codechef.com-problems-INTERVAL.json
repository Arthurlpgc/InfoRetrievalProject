The game consist of two sequences of integers  A  of length  N  and  B  of length  M , and it will last for exactly  M  turns, Chef will play in odd turns whereas Chefu will play in even turns (turns and sequences are 1-based). In the  i -th turn, the corresponding player should select an interval (continuous subsegment) of sequence  A  of length  B i  that is  strictly  inside the interval selected in previous turn, i.e. if the interval in previous turn was  [l,r]  then if the interval in current turn is  [u,v]  then it should satisfy  l < u \u2264 v < r , except in the first turn where the player can select any interval of length  B 1 . Initially the score of the game is 0. If it was  Chef 's turn then we  add  to the score of the game points equal to sum of integers of the selected interval of sequence  A . If it was  Chefu 's turn then we  subtract  from the score of the game points equal to sum of integers of the selected interval of sequence  A . Chef wants to maximize the score of the game in the end while Chefu want to minimize it. Can you find out the score of the game in the end given that both Chef and Chefu are playing optimally. The first line contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test-cases. Description of  T  test cases follow. First line of each test case contains two space separated integers  N  and  M , denoting the length of the sequence and the number of turns for which the game will last, respectively. Second line of each test case contains  N  space separated integers denoting the sequence  A Third line of each test case contains  M  space separated integers denoting the sequence  B For each test case, output a single integer in a separate line corresponding to the score of the game at the end of the game. Example case 1.  Chef chooses the interval  [1, 6]  (i.e.  (3, 7, 5, 4, 9, 6) ). The score now is 34 points. In the next turn, Chefu chooses the interval  [3, 5]  (i.e.  (5, 4, 9) ). The score now is 34 - 18 = 16 points. In the next turn, Chef chooses the interval  [4, 4]  (i.e.  (4) ). So finally score of the game is 16 + 4 =20. This is the score of the game when both Chef and Chefu play optimally.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
