You are given a matrix  A  of  N  rows and  M  columns where  A ij  is  1  if the  i-th  boy likes the  j-th  girl, otherwise it will be 0. Note that it is not necessary that if a boy  x  likes girl  y , then girl  y  should like boy  x . You know that if there are two different boys  x  and  y , who both like girl  z , then there will be a collision.\nCan you calculate the number of different collisions at this party? Note that order of boys in the collision doesn't matter. The first line contains a single integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. Then  T  test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers  N ,  M  denoting the number of boys and girls, respectively. Each of the following  N  lines contain  M  characters, each of them is either  '0'  or  '1' . For each test case output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of collisions at the party. Example Case 1.  All three boys like the first girl, so there are  (1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 1), (2, 3, 1)  collisions with her. Boys  1  and  3  both like the second girl so this is one more collision. Only one boy likes the third girl, so there are no collisions with her and thus we have  4  collisions total. Example Case 2.  For each girl there is only one boy who likes her, so there are no collisions at all.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
