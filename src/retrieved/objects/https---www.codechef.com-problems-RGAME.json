The game goes as follows:\n \n N+1  numbers occur sequentially (one at a time) from  A 0  to  A N . \n You must write the numbers on a sheet of paper, such that  A 0  is written first. The other numbers are written according to an inductive rule \u2014 after  A i-1  numbers have been written in a row, then  A i  can be written at either end of the row. That is, you first write  A 0 , and then  A 1  can be written on its left or right to make  A 0 A 1  or  A 1 A 0 , and so on. \n A i  must be written before writing  A j , for every  i < j . \n For a move in which you write a number  A i  (i>0) , your points increase by the product of  A i  and its neighbour. (Note that for any move it will have only one neighbour as you write the number at an end). \n Total score of a game is the score you attain after placing all the  N + 1  numbers. Princess Rupsa wants to find out the sum of scores obtained by all possible different gameplays. Two gameplays are different, if after writing down all  N + 1  numbers, when we read from left to right, there exists some position  i , at which the gameplays have  a j  and  a k  written at the  i th  position such that  j \u2260 k . But since she has recently found her true love, a frog Prince, and is in a hurry to meet him, you must help her solve the problem as fast as possible. Since the answer can be very large, print the answer modulo  10 9  + 7 .    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
