He always leaves things to last minute. Now Jem has  N  problems in the assignment of \"Advanced topics in algorithm\" class to solved. The assignment is due tomorrow and as you may guess he hasn't touch any of the problems. Fortunately he got a plan as always.\n \nThe first step will be buying a pack of Red Bull and then to work as hard as he can. Here is how he is going to spend the remaining time:\n \nJem will not take a break until he finishes at least half of the remaining problems. Formally, if  N  is even then he will take he first break after finishing  N  / 2 problems. If  N  is odd then the break will be after he done ( N  + 1) / 2 problems. Each of his break will last for  B  minutes. Initially, he takes  M  minutes in solving a problem, after each break he will take twice more time in solving a problem, i.e.  2 * M  minutes per problem after the first break.\n \nJem will start working soon and ask you to help him calculate how much time it will take until he finish the last problem!\n \nThe first line contains a single integer  T  represents the number of test cases in the input. \nFor each test case output a single line containing an integer represent how much time Jem will need (in minutes).\n \nIn the first test case, Jem will proceed as below:\n \n \n Initially, Jem has 9 problems to solve. since it is an odd number, Jem will finish the first (9 + 1) / 2 = 5 problems with speed of 2 minutes/problem. \n After that, Jem takes 1 minute break. \n Now he has 4 problems to solve, which is an even number, so Jem will solve the next 4 / 2 = 2 problems. his speed after the first break has now became 4 minutes/problem.\n \n Again, he takes a 1 minute break. \n he has now 2 problems left so he do one more problem in 8 minutes. \n He takes 1 minute break. \n he solves the last problem in 16 minutes. \n \n \nSo, Jem will need time = 5 \u00d7 2 + 1 + 2 \u00d7 4 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 16  = 45\n    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
