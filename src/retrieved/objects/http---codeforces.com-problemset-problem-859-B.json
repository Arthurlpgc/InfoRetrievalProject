Lazy Security Guard time limit per test 2 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output Your security guard friend recently got a new job at a new security company. The company requires him to patrol an area of the city encompassing exactly  N  city blocks, but they let him choose which blocks. That is, your friend must walk the perimeter of a region whose area is exactly  N  blocks. Your friend is quite lazy and would like your help to find the shortest possible route that meets the requirements. The city is laid out in a square grid pattern, and is large enough that for the sake of the problem it can be considered infinite. Input Input will consist of a single integer  N  ( 1\u2009\u2264\u2009 N \u2009\u2264\u200910 6 ), the number of city blocks that must be enclosed by the route. Output Print the minimum perimeter that can be achieved. Examples Input 4 Output 8 Input 11 Output 14 Input 22 Output 20 Note Here are some possible shapes for the examples: B.
