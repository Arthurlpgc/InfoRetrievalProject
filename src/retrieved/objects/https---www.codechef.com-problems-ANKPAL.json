So, as to gauge his knowledge, Lucy challenges him to a task. \"Given a string  s , answer several times a query to determine whether a  substring   s[i, j]  (inclusive) is palindromic or not.\", said Lucy in a confident tone! As smart as Mark is, he was able to instantly find the solution! Now, Mark has challenged little Lucy to do the same task by reversing a specific substring beforehand. As Lucy is still just a novice, she asks for your help. You have to write a program that answers  Q  queries on a string  S . Each query contains four integers ( i ,  j ,  k ,  l ).\nFor every query, first reverse the  substring   s[i, j]  (inclusive) and then report if  substring   s[k, l]  (inclusive) is a palindrome. Note that the reversal operations are only for the specific query and should not persist for further queries. Please check the explanation section for better understanding. The first line of input file contains string  S . The next line contains an integer  Q . \nEach of the following  Q  lines each contain 4 space separated integers  i, j, k and l. Output exactly  Q  lines, each containing the result of corresponding query as  \"Yes\"  or  \"No\" . Sample Input: Sample Output: Query 1: \nThe string becomes a ab ba. The queried substring  is  bb , which is a palindrome. Query 2: \nThe string becomes  ba aba. The queried substring is  ab , which is not a palindrome. Query 3: \nThe string becomes  aba ba. The queried substring is  aba , which is a palindrome. Query 4: \nThe string becomes a bab a. The queried substring is  ababa , which is a palindrome.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
