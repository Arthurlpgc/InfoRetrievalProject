His films have a unique characteristic of connecting with youth by using popular culture references. They are usually divided into various sub-parts denoted by chapters. His plot of stories is never linear, he always make sure that the chapters should never be shown in the order of Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, ,.. Chapter  n  linearly. He believes doing this an insult to the intelligence of viewers. For example, Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3 can never be a chapter sequence in Tarantino's movies.. He can have a sequence of Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 1 instead.\n \nRecently Santa gifted Tom a movie which consists of  n  chapters. This movie can possibly be directed by your favorite Tarantino or by someone else. Directors in hollywood can sometimes be very sloppy, they sometimes drop some chapters too and stupid they are that they will leave numbering of the chapters as it is and one can easily identify the chapters that were dropped. For example, if you find the sequence of chapters as - chapter 1, chapter 5, chapter 3, don't be surprised, they did not even take burden of renumbering the chapters to chapter 1, chapter 3, chapter 2. They can sometimes repeat the chapter numbers too. Remember that Tarantino is not a sloppy director, so he never makes this kind of stupid mistakes.\n \nTom happened to find the sequence of chapters in the movie, this sequence contains  n  chapters,  i -th of which is denoted by  chapter i . Tom is a big fan of movies of Tarantino. So, Tom  would like to check whether the movie could possibly be directed by Tarantino or not? Please help Tom, he really needs it.\n The first line contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases.  T  test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer  n  denoting number of chapters of the movie. The second line of each test case contains  n  space separated integers  chapter i , denoting numbering of  i th  chapter. For each test case, output \"yes\" or \"no\" in a separate line. All the examples are explained in the problem statement.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
