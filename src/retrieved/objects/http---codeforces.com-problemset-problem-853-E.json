Lada Malina time limit per test 5 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output After long-term research and lots of experiments leading Megapolian automobile manufacturer \u00abAutoVoz\u00bb released a brand new car model named \u00abLada Malina\u00bb. One of the most impressive features of \u00abLada Malina\u00bb is its highly efficient environment-friendly engines. Consider car as a point in  Oxy  plane. Car is equipped with  k  engines numbered from  1  to  k . Each engine is defined by its velocity vector whose coordinates are  ( vx i ,\u2009 vy i )  measured in distance units per day. An engine may be turned on at any level  w i , that is a real number between  \u2009-\u20091  and  \u2009+\u20091  (inclusive) that result in a term of  ( w i \u00b7 vx i ,\u2009 w i \u00b7 vy i )  in the final car velocity. Namely, the final car velocity is equal to  ( w 1 \u00b7 vx 1 \u2009+\u2009 w 2 \u00b7 vx 2 \u2009+\u2009...\u2009+\u2009 w k \u00b7 vx k ,\u2009\u00a0\u00a0 w 1 \u00b7 vy 1 \u2009+\u2009 w 2 \u00b7 vy 2 \u2009+\u2009...\u2009+\u2009 w k \u00b7 vy k )   Formally, if car moves with constant values of  w i  during the whole day then its  x -coordinate will change by the first component of an expression above, and its  y -coordinate will change by the second component of an expression above. For example, if all  w i  are equal to zero, the car won't move, and if all  w i  are equal to zero except  w 1 \u2009=\u20091 , then car will move with the velocity of the first engine. There are  n  factories in Megapolia,  i -th of them is located in  ( fx i ,\u2009 fy i ) . On the  i -th factory there are  a i  cars \u00abLada Malina\u00bb that are ready for operation. As an attempt to increase sales of a new car, \u00abAutoVoz\u00bb is going to hold an international exposition of cars. There are  q  options of exposition location and time, in the  i -th of them exposition will happen in a point with coordinates  ( px i ,\u2009 py i )  in  t i  days.  Of course, at the \u00abAutoVoz\u00bb is going to bring as much new cars from factories as possible to the place of exposition. Cars are going to be moved by enabling their engines on some certain levels, such that at the beginning of an exposition car gets exactly to the exposition location.  However, for some of the options it may be impossible to bring cars from some of the factories to the exposition location by the moment of an exposition. Your task is to determine for each of the options of exposition location and time how many cars will be able to get there by the beginning of an exposition.

Car is equipped with  k  engines numbered from  1  to  k . Each engine is defined by its velocity vector whose coordinates are  ( vx i ,\u2009 vy i )  measured in distance units per day. An engine may be turned on at any level  w i , that is a real number between  \u2009-\u20091  and  \u2009+\u20091  (inclusive) that result in a term of  ( w i \u00b7 vx i ,\u2009 w i \u00b7 vy i )  in the final car velocity. Namely, the final car velocity is equal to  ( w 1 \u00b7 vx 1 \u2009+\u2009 w 2 \u00b7 vx 2 \u2009+\u2009...\u2009+\u2009 w k \u00b7 vx k ,\u2009\u00a0\u00a0 w 1 \u00b7 vy 1 \u2009+\u2009 w 2 \u00b7 vy 2 \u2009+\u2009...\u2009+\u2009 w k \u00b7 vy k )   Formally, if car moves with constant values of  w i  during the whole day then its  x -coordinate will change by the first component of an expression above, and its  y -coordinate will change by the second component of an expression above. For example, if all  w i  are equal to zero, the car won't move, and if all  w i  are equal to zero except  w 1 \u2009=\u20091 , then car will move with the velocity of the first engine. There are  n  factories in Megapolia,  i -th of them is located in  ( fx i ,\u2009 fy i ) . On the  i -th factory there are  a i  cars \u00abLada Malina\u00bb that are ready for operation. As an attempt to increase sales of a new car, \u00abAutoVoz\u00bb is going to hold an international exposition of cars. There are  q  options of exposition location and time, in the  i -th of them exposition will happen in a point with coordinates  ( px i ,\u2009 py i )  in  t i  days.  Of course, at the \u00abAutoVoz\u00bb is going to bring as much new cars from factories as possible to the place of exposition. Cars are going to be moved by enabling their engines on some certain levels, such that at the beginning of an exposition car gets exactly to the exposition location.  However, for some of the options it may be impossible to bring cars from some of the factories to the exposition location by the moment of an exposition.

For example, if all  w i  are equal to zero, the car won't move, and if all  w i  are equal to zero except  w 1 \u2009=\u20091 , then car will move with the velocity of the first engine. There are  n  factories in Megapolia,  i -th of them is located in  ( fx i ,\u2009 fy i ) . On the  i -th factory there are  a i  cars \u00abLada Malina\u00bb that are ready for operation. As an attempt to increase sales of a new car, \u00abAutoVoz\u00bb is going to hold an international exposition of cars. There are  q  options of exposition location and time, in the  i -th of them exposition will happen in a point with coordinates  ( px i ,\u2009 py i )  in  t i  days.  Of course, at the \u00abAutoVoz\u00bb is going to bring as much new cars from factories as possible to the place of exposition. Cars are going to be moved by enabling their engines on some certain levels, such that at the beginning of an exposition car gets exactly to the exposition location.  However, for some of the options it may be impossible to bring cars from some of the factories to the exposition location by the moment of an exposition. Your task is to determine for each of the options of exposition location and time how many cars will be able to get there by the beginning of an exposition.
