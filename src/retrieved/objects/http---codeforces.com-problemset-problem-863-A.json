Quasi-palindrome time limit per test 1 second memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output Let  quasi-palindromic  number be such number that adding some leading zeros (possible none) to it produces a palindromic string.  String  t  is called a palindrome, if it reads the same from left to right and from right to left. For example, numbers  131  and  2010200  are  quasi-palindromic , they can be transformed to strings \" 131 \" and \" 002010200 \", respectively, which are palindromes. You are given some integer number  x . Check if it's a  quasi-palindromic  number. Input The first line contains one integer number  x  ( 1\u2009\u2264\u2009 x \u2009\u2264\u200910 9 ). This number is given without any leading zeroes. Output Print \" YES \" if number  x  is  quasi-palindromic . Otherwise, print \" NO \" (without quotes). Examples Input 131 Output YES Input 320 Output NO Input 2010200 Output YES A.
