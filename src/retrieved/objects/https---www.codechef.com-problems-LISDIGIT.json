To be precise, he means longest  strictly  increasing subsequence, when he talks of longest increasing subsequence.  To check his understanding, he took his favorite  n -digit number and for each of its  n  digits, he computed the length of the longest increasing subsequence of digits ending with that digit. Then he stored these lengths in an array named  LIS . For example, let us say that Chef's favourite  4 -digit number is  1531 , then the  LIS  array would be  [1, 2, 2, 1] . The length of longest increasing subsequence ending at first digit is  1  (the digit  1  itself) and at the second digit is  2  ( [1, 5] ), at third digit is also  2  ( [1, 3] ), and at the  4 th digit is  1  (the digit  1  itself). Now Chef wants to give you a challenge. He has a valid  LIS  array with him, and wants you to find any  n -digit number having exactly the same  LIS  array? You are guaranteed that Chef's  LIS  array is valid, i.e. there exists at least one  n -digit number corresponding to the given  LIS  array. The first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases.  For each test case, the first line contains an integer  n  denoting the number of digits in Chef's favourite number. The second line will contain  n  space separated integers denoting  LIS  array, i.e.  LIS 1 , LIS 2 , ..., LIS n . For each test case, output a single  n -digit number (without leading zeroes) having exactly the given  LIS  array. If there are multiple  n -digit numbers satisfying this requirement, any of them will be accepted. Example case 1.  All one-digit numbers have the same  LIS  array, so any answer from  0  to  9  will be accepted. Example cases 2 & 3.  For a two digit number we always have  LIS 1  = 1 , but the value of  LIS 2  depends on whether the first digit is strictly less than the second one. If this is the case (like for number  36 ),  LIS 2  = 2 , otherwise (like for numbers  54  or  77 ) the values of  LIS 2  is  1 . Example case 4.  This has already been explained in the problem statement. Example case 5.   7 -digit number  1730418  has  LIS  array  [1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4] :\n \n \n index \n LIS \n length \n \n \n 1 \n 1 730418 \n 1 \n \n \n 2 \n 17 30418 \n 2 \n \n \n 3 \n 1 7 3 0418 \n 2 \n \n \n 4 \n 173 0 418 \n 1 \n \n \n 5 \n 1 7 3 0 4 18 \n 3 \n \n \n 6 \n 173 0 4 1 8 \n 2 \n \n \n 7 \n 1 7 3 0 4 1 8 \n 4 \n \n \n    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
