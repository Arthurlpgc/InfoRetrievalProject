Each of the elements is an integer from  1  to  n . Recently Ivan learned about permutations and their lexicographical order. Now he wants to change (replace)  minimum  number of elements in his array in such a way that his array becomes a  permutation  (i.e. each of the integers from  1  to  n  was encountered in his array exactly once). If there are multiple ways to do it he wants to find the  lexicographically minimal  permutation among them. Thus minimizing the number of changes has the first priority, lexicographical minimizing has the second priority. In order to determine which of the two permutations is lexicographically smaller, we compare their first elements. If they are equal \u2014 compare the second, and so on. If we have two permutations  x  and  y , then  x  is lexicographically smaller if  x i \u2009<\u2009 y i , where  i  is the first index in which the permutations  x  and  y  differ.

Examples Input 4 3 2 2 3 Output 2 1 2 4 3  Input 6 4 5 6 3 2 1 Output 0 4 5 6 3 2 1  Input 10 6 8 4 6 7 1 6 3 4 5 Output 3 2 8 4 6 7 1 9 3 10 5  Note In the first example Ivan needs to replace number three in position  1  with number one, and number two in position  3  with number four. Then he will get a permutation  [1, 2, 4, 3]  with only two changed numbers \u2014 this permutation is lexicographically minimal among all suitable.  In the second example Ivan does not need to change anything because his array already is a permutation.", "memory-limit": 256}
