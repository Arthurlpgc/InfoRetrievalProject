Devu went to the market and saw that there were  N  people selling grapes. He didn\u2019t like it because things were not very structured. So, he gave a task to Dhinwa to make things better. If Dhinwa successfully completes the task, Devu will be happy.\n \nDevu wants to change the number of grapes in a bucket of zero or more sellers in such a way that the  GCD   of all the number of grapes is divisible by K. Dhinwa can add or remove any number of grapes from each of the buckets. Adding or removing a grape will be counted as an operation. Also after the operation, none of the seller\u2019s bucket should be empty.\n \nHelp Dhinwa in finding the minimum number of operations needed to make Devu happy.\n For each test case, print a single integer representing the answer of that test case. \n Subtask #1: 10 points \n Subtask #2: 10 points \n Subtask #3: 80 points Input: \n2\n2 2\n3 5\n3 7\n10 16 18\n\n Output: \n2\n8\n \nFor the first test case, add or remove 1 grape in each of the bucket.\n \nFor the second test case, remove three grapes in the first bucket, remove two grapes from the second bucket and add three grapes in the third bucket.\n    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
