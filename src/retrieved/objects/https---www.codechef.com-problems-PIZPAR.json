He wants to invite as many people to the party. However, he knows that everyone will have exactly one slice of a pizza (regardless of the size) and he wants to make sure that he has enough pizza slices.  Chef is very lazy and will only make a total of  N  straight cuts among all the pizzas. Each pizza is also of different size and to avoid the slices getting too small the chef can only make a max of A i  cuts to the i th  pizza. He wants to maximize the number of slices of pizza. Since chef is busy with preparing other aspects of the party he wants you to find out the maximum number of slices he can get following the constraints.  If a pizza is not cut at all then it is considered as 1 slice. \u00a0 First line contains two integers M and N.\nThe second line of input contains the array A. Output a single integer - the maximum number of slices chef can get. \u00a0 Example case 1. One of the optimal way to cut would be to do {0, 1,  0, 4, 5} cuts.

After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
