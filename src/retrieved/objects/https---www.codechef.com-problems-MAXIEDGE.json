Two cells are said to be adjacent if they share a side with each other. The  score  of such a grid is defined to be the number of unordered pairs of adjacent cells, which have the same character in them. You want to rearrange the letters of the grid in such a way that the score is maximized and print the new rearranged grid. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any. The first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. The description of  T  test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer  N , denoting the number of columns in the grid. Each of the next two lines contains a string consisting of  N  lowercase English characters, describing the first and the second rows of the grid respectively. For each test case, output two lines, each containing a string of length  N . These should describe the first and the second rows of the rearranged grid. Let (r, c) denote the cell on the r-th row and c-th column. Example case 1 : The score of the new grid is 2. The two unordered pairs of cells are {(1, 1), (1, 2)} (these two cells share a side, and have the same letter 'a' in them) and {(2, 1), (2, 2)} (these two cells share a side, and have the same letter 'b' in them). This is the maximum score that we can obtain.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
