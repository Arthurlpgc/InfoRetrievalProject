All except one cell in this grid contains a ball each, i.e. exactly one of the cells is empty, and the others contain exactly 1 ball. You are allowed to make one of the following two kind of moves one by one in any order: \n \n Choose two adjacent cells one containing a ball and other being empty. Move the ball to the empty cell. Two cells are said to be adjacent to each other if they share a side with each other. \n Choose three consecutive cells (either horizontal or vertical), in which the middle cell has a ball, one of the other cells has a ball and the remaining one is empty. You can move the ball from the non-empty non-middle cell to the empty cell, and destroy the ball in the middle cell while jumping over it, thus making middle cell empty too. \n \n You are asked to play this game. At the end of the game, you win if there is exactly one cell containing a ball. You can make at max 5000 moves per testcase. Find any possible sequence of moves to win this game. If this is impossible to achieve, print -1. The first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. The description of  T  test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers,  n, m  which are the dimensions of the grid. The i-th of the next  n  lines contains  m  characters. denoting the i-th row of the grid. The character '.' denotes that cell is empty, whereas '*' denotes that the cell has a ball in it. For each test case, the first line should contain an integer X which will denote the number of moves you want to make. If it is impossible to achieve the desired objective, this integer should be -1. This number X should be at most 5000. If it is possible to achieve the objective, then each of the next X lines should contain four space separated integers: x1, y1, x2, y2 which signifies the following.\nIf you are making the first type of move, then you are moving the ball from the cell (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).\nIn the second type of move, it will denote that the non-middle cell with ball is (x1, y1) and the empty cell is (x2, y2). \nIn first move, you can take the ball at (2, 1) and move it to cell (2, 3), and the ball at cell (2, 2) will be destroyed. The resulting grid will be \n In second move, you can move the ball at cell (1, 1) to cell (2, 1). The resulting grid will be Now, you can move the ball (1, 3) to (1, 1) and destroying the ball at (1, 2), we get. Now, move the ball at cell (2, 1) to (2, 2) Move the ball at cell (2, 3) to (2, 1) by destroying the ball at cell (2, 2). Move the ball at cell (2, 1) to (2, 2) Move the ball at cell (2, 2) to (1, 2) Now, move the ball cell (1, 1) to (1, 3), thus destroying the ball at (1, 2). And you are done :)    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
