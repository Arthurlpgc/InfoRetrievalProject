Of course! This number has such a lot of properties, like:\n \n Four is the smallest composite number; \n It is also the smallest Smith number; \n The smallest non-cyclic group has four elements; \n Four is the maximal degree of the equation that can be solved in radicals; \n There is four-color theorem that states that any map can be colored in no more than four colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions are colored in the same color; \n Lagrange's four-square theorem states that every positive integer can be written as the sum of at most four square numbers; \n Four is the maximum number of dimensions of a real division algebra; \n In bases 6 and 12, 4 is a 1-automorphic number; \n And there are a lot more cool stuff about this number! \n \n Impressed by the power of this number, Kostya has begun to look for occurrences of four anywhere. He has a list of  T  integers, for each of them he wants to calculate the number of occurrences of the digit  4  in the decimal representation. He is too busy now, so please help him. The first line of input consists of a single integer  T , denoting the number of integers in Kostya's list. Then, there are  T  lines, each of them contain a single integer from the list. Output  T  lines. Each of these lines should contain the number of occurences of the digit  4  in the respective integer from Kostya's list.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
