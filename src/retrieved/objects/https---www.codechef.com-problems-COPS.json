The first house is numbered 1 and the last one is numbered 100. Some  M  houses out of these 100 are occupied by cops. Thief Devu has just stolen PeePee's bag and is looking for a house to hide in. PeePee uses fast 4G Internet and sends the message to all the cops that a thief named Devu has just stolen her bag and ran into some house. Devu knows that the cops run at a maximum speed of  x  houses per minute in a straight line and they will search for a maximum of  y  minutes. Devu wants to know how many houses are safe for him to escape from the cops. Help him in getting this information. First line contains  T , the number of test cases to follow. First line of each test case contains 3 space separated integers:  M ,  x  and  y . For each test case, the second line contains  M  space separated integers which represent the house numbers where the cops are residing. For each test case, output a single line containing the number of houses which are safe to hide from cops. Example 1 :  Cops in house 12 can cover houses 1 to 68, and cops in house 52 can cover the rest of the houses. So, there is no safe house. Example 2 :  Cops in house 21 can cover houses 1 to 41, and cops in house 75 can cover houses 55 to 95, leaving houses numbered 42 to 54, and 96 to 100 safe. So, in total 18 houses are safe.

After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
