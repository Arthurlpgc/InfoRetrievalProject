Chtholly has been thinking about a problem for days: If a number is  palindrome  and length of its decimal representation without leading zeros is even, we call it a zcy number. A number is  palindrome  means when written in decimal representation, it contains no leading zeros and reads the same forwards and backwards. For example  12321  and  1221  are palindromes and  123  and  12451  are not. Moreover,  1221  is zcy number and  12321  is not. Given integers  k  and  p , calculate the sum of the  k  smallest zcy numbers and output this sum modulo  p . Unfortunately, Willem isn't good at solving this kind of problems, so he asks you for help!
