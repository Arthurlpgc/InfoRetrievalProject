He owns a brand new Android phone of screen size of dimension  n \u00d7 m  ( n  denotes the height of the phone and  m  denotes the width). Chef wants to design a program for painting the screen. He figured out  c  colors, which he will use to paint the screen. He wants to paint some rectangular section of pixels of the screen each with different color. Also Chef would like to use all of his  c  colors in painting. Can you help Chef in finding number of different dimensions of rectangular section he can paint? In other words, find number of pairs  x, y  such that Chef can paint a rectangular section of dimension  x \u00d7 y  ( x  denotes height,  y  denotes width) on the screen. Please note that Chef uses a fix orientation of his phone and is not allowed to rotate it, i.e. height always stays  n  and width always stays  m  and not the other way around. First line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases.  T  test cases follow. Only line of each test case contains three space separated integers  n, m, c . For each test case, output a single line containing the answer for the test case. Test case 1.  Possible pairs of dimensions are  (2, 6) ,  (3, 4)  and  (4, 3) . Note that the rectangular section of dimension  (1, 12)  can't be painted as it can't fit into the screen, because 12 > 6. Test case 2.  There does not exist any rectangle of desired dimensions which can have 10 different pixels painted.

After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
