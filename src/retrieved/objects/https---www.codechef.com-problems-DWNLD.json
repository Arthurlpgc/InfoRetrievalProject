His history of internet data usage is provided as below. During the first  T 1  minutes, the internet data used was  D 1  MBs per minute, and during the next  T 2  minutes, it was  D 2  MBs per minute, and so on till during last  T N  minutes it was  D N  MBs per minute. The internet provider charges the Chef  1  dollar for every  1  MB data used, except for the first  K  minutes, when the internet data is free as part of the plan provided to Chef. Please find out the total amount that Chef has to pay the internet provider (in dollars). First line of the input contains a single integer  TC  the number of test cases. Description of  TC  test cases follow. First line of each test case contains two space separated integers  N  and  K . Next  N  lines of each test case contains information about the internet data usage. Specifically, in the  i -th line, there will be two space separated integers:  T i  and  D i . For each test case output a single integer in separate line, the amount that Chef has to pay in dollars. Example case 1.  For the first two minutes, internet data of usage of Chef is free. He has to pay for last 2 minutes only, for which he will be charged at 3 dollars per minute, i.e. total 6 dollars. Example case 2.  For the first two minutes, internet data of usage of Chef is free. He has to pay for last 1 minute only, for which he is being charged at 3 dollars per minute. So, in total he has to pay 3 dollars. Example case 3.  This time, Chef is not provided any free data usage. He has to pay \nfor entire data usage, which comes out to be 1 * 2 + 2 * 4 + 10 * 10 = 110 dollars.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
