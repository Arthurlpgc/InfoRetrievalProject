Binary Matrix time limit per test 3 seconds memory limit per test 16 megabytes input standard input output standard output You are given a matrix of size  n \u2009\u00d7\u2009 m . Each element of the matrix is either 1 or 0. You have to determine the number of connected components consisting of 1's. Two cells belong to the same component if they have a common border, and both elements in these cells are 1's. Note that the memory limit is unusual! Input The first line contains two numbers  n  and  m  ( 1\u2009\u2264\u2009 n \u2009\u2264\u20092 12 ,  4\u2009\u2264\u2009 m \u2009\u2264\u20092 14 ) \u2014 the number of rows and columns, respectively. It is guaranteed that  m  is divisible by 4. Then the representation of matrix follows. Each of  n  next lines contains   one-digit hexadecimal numbers (that is, these numbers can be represented either as digits from  0  to  9  or as uppercase Latin letters from  A  to  F ). Binary representation of each of these numbers denotes next  4  elements of the matrix in the corresponding row. For example, if the number  B  is given, then the corresponding elements are  1011 , and if the number is  5 , then the corresponding elements are  0101 . Elements are not separated by whitespaces. Output Print the number of connected components consisting of 1's.
