The cash machine will only accept the transaction if  X  is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges).  For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.    Positive integer 0 <  X  <= 2000 - the amount of cash which Pooja wishes to withdraw.  Nonnegative number 0<=  Y  <= 2000 with two digits of precision - Pooja's initial account balance. Output the account balance after the attempted transaction, given as a number with two digits of precision.  If there is not enough money in the account to complete the transaction, output the current bank balance.

Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
