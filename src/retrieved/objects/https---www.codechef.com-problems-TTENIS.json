He found some statistics of matches which described who won the points in order. A game shall be won by the player first scoring 11 points except in the case when both players have 10 points each, then the game shall be won by the first player subsequently gaining a lead of 2 points. Could you please help the Chef find out who the winner was from the given statistics? (It is guaranteed that statistics represent  always a valid, finished match.)  The first line of the input contains an integer  T , denoting the number of test cases. The description of  T  test cases follows. Each test case consist a binary string  S , which describes a match. '0' means Chef lose a point, whereas '1' means he won the point. \nFor each test case, output on a separate line a string describing who won the match. If Chef won then print \"WIN\" (without quotes), otherwise print \"LOSE\" (without quotes).\n \u00a0 Example case 1.  Chef won the match 11:2, his opponent won just two points, the first and the third of the match. Example case 2.  Chef lost this match 11:3, however he started very well the match, he won the first three points in a row, but maybe he got tired and after that lost 11 points in a row.

After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
