Chefu is practicing very hard to become a very skilled competitive programmer and win gold medal in IOI. Now Chefu is participating in a contest and the problem that he is trying to solve states: Given an array  A  of  N  integers, find any  i ,  j  such that  i  <   j  \n and  A i  +  A j  is maximum possible  unfortunately, there's no much time left before the end of the contest, so Chefu doesn't have time to think of correct solution, so instead, he wrote a solution that selects a random pair ( i ,   j ) ( i  <   j ) and output  A i  +  A j . each pair is equiprobable to be selected. Now Chefu wants your help to calculate the probability that his solution will pass a particular input. \u00a0 First line contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test-cases. First line of each test-case contains a single integer  N Second line of each test-case contains  N  space-separated integers  A 1   A 2  ...  A N \u00a0 For each test-case output a single line containing a single number denoting the probability that Chefu's solution to output a correct answer. your answer will be accepted if the absolute difference between it and correct answer is less than 1e-6 \u00a0 \u00a0    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
