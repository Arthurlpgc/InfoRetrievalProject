The nodes are numbered from 1 to  N , and each node is colored either white or black. You are given  Q  queries, where each query is of the form ( s ,  b ). You need to check if there is a connected subgraph of size exactly  s , which contains exactly  b  black nodes. A subgraph H, of a tree T, is a graph whose vertex set V H  is a subset of the nodes of the tree and the edges are exactly those edges of the tree whose both end points are in V H . A subgraph H is a connected subgraph if H is connected. Query 1 : The subgraph containing the nodes {6, 7, 9} is a connected subgraph because (6, 7) and (6, 9) are edges in the original tree. And it has exactly two black nodes (7 and 9). So, there is at least one connected subgraph of size exactly 3 which has exactly 2 black nodes. Hence the answer is \"Yes\". Query 2 : The subgraph containing the nodes {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8} is a connected subgraph. And it has exactly three black nodes (2, 4 and 7). So, there is at least one connected subgraph of size exactly 7 which has exactly 3 black nodes. Hence the answer is \"Yes\". Query 3 : There is no connected subgraph of size exactly 4 with all white nodes. Hence the answer is \"No\". Query 4 : The only subgraph with 9 nodes is the entire tree itself. And it has 4 black nodes, and not 5. Hence the answer is \"No\".    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
