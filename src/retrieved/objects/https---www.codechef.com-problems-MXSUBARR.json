A group of disjoint subarrays in it will be a collection of subarrays of the array. Formally a group of subarrays consisting of  K  subarrays can be denoted by  2 * K  indices,  [i 1 , j 1 ] ,  [i 2 , j 2 ]  , ...,  [i K , j K ] , such that  i 1  \u2264 j 1  < i 2  \u2264 j 2  < ... <  i K  \u2264 j K . \n \nFor example, in array  A = {5, 6, 7} . A group of subarrays could be the subarrays denoted by indices  [1, 1], [2, 3] . The subarray corresponding to indices  [1, 1]  will be  {5} . The subarray corresponding to indices  [2, 3]  will be  {6, 7} . So, we have  i 1  = 1, j 1  = 1, i 2  = 2, j 2  = 3  and  K = 2 . You can check that the indices satisfy the property  i 1  \u2264 j 1  < i 2  \u2264 j 2 .\n \nNote that the group of subarrays  [1, 2]  and  [2, 3]  won't be disjoint, as it does not satisfy the property  j 1  < i 2 . In other words, the index 2 is common in two subarrays, which should not happen.\n \nLet  M  denote the maximum value of  K  in a group of  K  disjoint subarrays of array  A , such that there are not two elements ( not indices ) common in those subarrays. This means, that if the group contained subarrays  [A[i 1 ], A[j 1 ] ,  [A[i 2 ], A[j 2 ]]  , ...,  A i<sub>K</sub>, j<sub>K</sub> , then there should not be an element which is present in more than one subarrays.\n \nYou have to find maximum number of group of disjoint subarrays that number of subarrays in those groups are equal to  M . As the answer could be large, output it modulo  10 9  + 7 .\n The first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. The description of  T  test cases follows. First line of the each test case contains a single integer  N  denoting number of elements in array  A . Second line of each test case contains  N  space separated integers denoting the elements of the array  A For each test case, output a single line corresponding to maximum number of group of disjoint subarrays of array  A . Subtask #1 (30 points) \n 1 \u2264  T, N  \u2264  10 3 \n 1 \u2264  A i  \u2264  n \n Sum of  N  over all the test cases in a single file won't exceed  10 3 \n \n \n Subtask #2 (70 points) Example case 1.   M  will be equal to 2. The subarrays will be {[1, 1], [2, 2]}. Example case 2.   M  will be equal to 3. The subarrays will be {[1, 1], [2, 2]}, {[1, 1], [3, 3]} and {[1, 1], [2, 3]}. Note that {[2, 2], [3, 3]} won't be a non-intersecting subarray as A[2] = 2 and A[3] = 2. So, 2 is common in both these subarrays.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
