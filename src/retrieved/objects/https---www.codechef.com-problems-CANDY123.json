Limak and Bob play the following game. Limak eats 1 candy, then Bob eats 2 candies, then Limak eats 3 candies, then Bob eats 4 candies, and so on. Once someone can't eat what he is supposed to eat, he loses. Limak can eat at most  A  candies in total (otherwise he would become sick), while Bob can eat at most  B  candies in total.\nWho will win the game?\nPrint \"Limak\" or \"Bob\" accordingly. The first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. The description of  T  test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers  A  and  B  denoting the maximum possible number of candies Limak can eat and the maximum possible number of candies Bob can eat respectively. For each test case, output a single line containing one string \u2014 the name of the winner (\"Limak\" or \"Bob\" without the quotes). Test case 1.  We have  A  = 3 and  B  = 2. Limak eats 1 candy first, and then Bob eats 2 candies. Then Limak is supposed to eat 3 candies but that would mean 1 + 3 = 4 candies in total. It's impossible because he can eat at most  A  candies, so he loses. Bob wins, and so we print \"Bob\". Test case 2.  Now we have  A  = 4 and  B  = 2. Limak eats 1 candy first, and then Bob eats 2 candies, then Limak eats 3 candies (he has 1 + 3 = 4 candies in total, which is allowed because it doesn't exceed  A ). Now Bob should eat 4 candies but he can't eat even a single one (he already ate 2 candies). Bob loses and Limak is the winner. Test case 8.  We have  A  = 9 and  B  = 12. The game looks as follows:    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
