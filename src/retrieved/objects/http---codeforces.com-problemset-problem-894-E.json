Ralph and Mushrooms time limit per test 2.5 seconds memory limit per test 512 megabytes input standard input output standard output Ralph is going to collect mushrooms in the Mushroom Forest.  There are  m  directed paths connecting  n  trees in the Mushroom Forest. On each path grow some mushrooms. When Ralph passes a path, he collects all the mushrooms on the path. The Mushroom Forest has a magical fertile ground where mushrooms grow at a fantastic speed. New mushrooms regrow as soon as Ralph finishes mushroom collection on a path. More specifically, after Ralph passes a path the  i -th time, there regrow  i  mushrooms less than there was before this pass. That is, if there is initially  x  mushrooms on a path, then Ralph will collect  x  mushrooms for the first time,  x \u2009-\u20091  mushrooms the second time,  x \u2009-\u20091\u2009-\u20092  mushrooms the third time, and so on. However, the number of mushrooms can never be less than  0 . For example, let there be  9  mushrooms on a path initially. The number of mushrooms that can be collected from the path is  9 ,  8 ,  6  and  3  when Ralph passes by from first to fourth time.

Each of the following  m  lines contains three integers  x ,  y  and  w  ( 1\u2009\u2264\u2009 x ,\u2009 y \u2009\u2264\u2009 n ,  0\u2009\u2264\u2009 w \u2009\u2264\u200910 8 ), denoting a path that leads from tree  x  to tree  y  with  w  mushrooms initially. There can be paths that lead from a tree to itself, and multiple paths between the same pair of trees. The last line contains a single integer  s  ( 1\u2009\u2264\u2009 s \u2009\u2264\u2009 n )\u00a0\u2014 the starting position of Ralph.  Output Print an integer denoting the maximum number of the mushrooms Ralph can collect during his route.  Examples Input 2 2 1 2 4 2 1 4 1 Output 16 Input 3 3 1 2 4 2 3 3 1 3 8 1 Output 8 Note In the first sample Ralph can pass three times on the circle and collect  4\u2009+\u20094\u2009+\u20093\u2009+\u20093\u2009+\u20091\u2009+\u20091\u2009=\u200916  mushrooms. After that there will be no mushrooms for Ralph to collect. In the second sample, Ralph can go to tree  3  and collect  8  mushrooms on the path from tree  1  to tree  3 . E. Ralph and Mushrooms time limit per test 2.5 seconds memory limit per test 512 megabytes input standard input output standard output Ralph is going to collect mushrooms in the Mushroom Forest.  There are  m  directed paths connecting  n  trees in the Mushroom Forest. On each path grow some mushrooms. When Ralph passes a path, he collects all the mushrooms on the path. The Mushroom Forest has a magical fertile ground where mushrooms grow at a fantastic speed. New mushrooms regrow as soon as Ralph finishes mushroom collection on a path. More specifically, after Ralph passes a path the  i -th time, there regrow  i  mushrooms less than there was before this pass. That is, if there is initially  x  mushrooms on a path, then Ralph will collect  x  mushrooms for the first time,  x \u2009-\u20091  mushrooms the second time,  x \u2009-\u20091\u2009-\u20092  mushrooms the third time, and so on. However, the number of mushrooms can never be less than  0 . For example, let there be  9  mushrooms on a path initially. The number of mushrooms that can be collected from the path is  9 ,  8 ,  6  and  3  when Ralph passes by from first to fourth time. From the fifth time and later Ralph can't collect any mushrooms from the path (but still can pass it). Ralph decided to start from the tree  s .
