He has to attend office regularly. But chef does not want to go to office, rather he wants to stay home and discover different recipes and cook them.  In the office where chef works, has two guards who count how many times a person enters into the office building. Though the duty of a guard is 24 hour in a day, but sometimes they fall asleep during their duty and could not track the entry of a person in the office building. But one better thing is that they never fall asleep at the same time. At least one of them remains awake and counts who enters into the office. Now boss of Chef wants to calculate how many times Chef has entered into the building. He asked to the guard and they give him two integers  A  and  B , count of first guard and second guard respectively. Help the boss to count the minimum and maximum number of times Chef could have entered into the office building. The first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. The description of the  T  test cases follows.  Each test case consists of a line containing two space separated integers  A  and  B . For each test case, output a single line containing two space separated integers, the minimum and maximum number of times Chef could have entered into the office building.

After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
