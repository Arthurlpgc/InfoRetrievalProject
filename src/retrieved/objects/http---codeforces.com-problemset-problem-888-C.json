K-Dominant Character time limit per test 2 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output You are given a string  s  consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Character  c  is called  k -dominant iff each substring of  s  with length at least  k  contains this character  c . You have to find minimum  k  such that there exists at least one  k -dominant character. Input The first line contains string  s  consisting of lowercase Latin letters ( 1\u2009\u2264\u2009| s |\u2009\u2264\u2009100000 ). Output Print one number \u2014 the minimum value of  k  such that there exists at least one  k -dominant character. Examples Input abacaba Output 2 Input zzzzz Output 1 Input abcde Output 3 C.
