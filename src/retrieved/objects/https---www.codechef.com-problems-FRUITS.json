His mom has surprised him with truly fruity gifts:  2 fruit baskets . The first basket contains  N  apples, and the second one contains  M  oranges. Chef likes apples and oranges very much but he likes them equally, and therefore, wants to have the minimum possible difference between the number of apples and oranges he has. To do so, he can purchase  1  apple or  1  orange by paying exactly  1  gold coin (that's some expensive fruit, eh?). Chef can purchase fruits at most  K  times (as he has  only   K  gold coins in his pocket) to make the difference the minimum possible. Our little Chef is busy in celebrating his birthday to the fullest, and therefore, he has handed this job to his best friend \u2014  you . Can you help him by finding the minimum possible difference he can achieve between the number of apples and orange he owns?\n\n Input \n The first line of input contains a single integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains  3  space separated integers \u2014  N ,  M  and  K  \u2014 denoting the number of apples, number of oranges, and number of gold coins our little Chef has. For each test case, output the minimum possible difference between the number of apples and oranges that Chef can achieve.

After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
