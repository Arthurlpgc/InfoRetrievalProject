On the ticket, there is a letter-code that can be represented as a string of upper-case Latin letters. Mike believes that the day will be successful in case  exactly two different letters  in the code alternate.  Otherwise, he believes that the day will be unlucky. Please see note section for formal definition of alternating code. You are given a ticket code. Please determine, whether the day will be successful for Mike or not. Print \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without quotes) corresponding to the situation. The first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. The description of  T  test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains a single string  S  denoting the letter code on the ticket. For each test case, output a single line containing \"YES\" (without quotes) in case the day will be successful and \"NO\" otherwise. \n \n 1  \u2264  T  \u2264  100 \n S  consists only of upper-case Latin letters \n \n Subtask 1 (50 points):\n \n |S|  =  2 \n \n Subtask 2 (50 points):\n \n 2  \u2264  |S|  \u2264  100 \n \n    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
