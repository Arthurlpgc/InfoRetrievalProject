A subarray of  A  is called  alternating  if any two adjacent elements in it have different signs (i.e. one of them should be negative and the other should be positive). \nFor each  x  from  1  to  N , compute the length of the longest alternating subarray that starts at  x  - that is, a subarray  A x..y  for the maximum possible  y \u2265 x . The length of such a subarray is  y-x+1 .\n For each test case, output one line with  N  space-separated integers - the lengths of the longest alternating subarray starting at  x , for each  x  from  1  to  N . Example case 1.  No two elements have different signs, so any alternating subarray may only consist of a single number. Example case 2.  Every subarray is alternating. Example case 3.  The only alternating subarray of length 3 is  A 3..5 .    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
