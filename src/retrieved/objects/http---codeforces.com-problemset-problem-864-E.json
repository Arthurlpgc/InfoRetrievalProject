Fire time limit per test 2 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output Polycarp is in really serious trouble \u2014 his house is on fire! It's time to save the most valuable items. Polycarp estimated that it would take  t i  seconds to save  i -th item. In addition, for each item, he estimated the value of  d i  \u2014 the moment after which the item  i  will be completely burned and will no longer be valuable for him at all. In particular, if  t i \u2009\u2265\u2009 d i , then  i -th item cannot be saved. Given the values  p i  for each of the items, find a set of items that Polycarp can save such that the total value of this items is maximum possible. Polycarp saves the items one after another. For example, if he takes item  a  first, and then item  b , then the item  a  will be saved in  t a  seconds, and the item  b  \u2014 in  t a \u2009+\u2009 t b  seconds after fire started. Input The first line contains a single integer  n  ( 1\u2009\u2264\u2009 n \u2009\u2264\u2009100 ) \u2014 the number of items in Polycarp's house.

For example, he can firstly save the third item in  3  seconds, and then save the second item in another  2  seconds. Thus, the total value of the saved items will be  6\u2009+\u20095\u2009=\u200911 . In the second example Polycarp can save only the first item, since even if he immediately starts saving the second item, he can save it in  3  seconds, but this item will already be completely burned by this time.
