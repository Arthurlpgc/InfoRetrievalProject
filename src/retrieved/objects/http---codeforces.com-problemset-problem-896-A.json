Nephren gives a riddle time limit per test 2 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us? Nephren is playing a game with little leprechauns. She gives them an infinite array of strings,  f 0... \u221e . f 0  is \" What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us? \". She wants to let more people know about it, so she defines  f i \u2009=\u2009  \" What are you doing while sending \" f i \u2009-\u20091 \"? Are you busy? Will you send \" f i \u2009-\u20091 \"? \" for all  i \u2009\u2265\u20091 . For example,  f 1  is \" What are you doing while sending \"What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy?

Note that the quotes in the very beginning and in the very end are for clarity and are not a part of  f 1 . It can be seen that the characters in  f i  are letters, question marks, (possibly) quotation marks and spaces. Nephren will ask the little leprechauns  q  times. Each time she will let them find the  k -th character of  f n . The characters are indexed starting from  1 . If  f n  consists of less than  k  characters, output ' . ' (without quotes). Can you answer her queries? Input The first line contains one integer  q  ( 1\u2009\u2264\u2009 q \u2009\u2264\u200910 )\u00a0\u2014 the number of Nephren's questions.

A. Nephren gives a riddle time limit per test 2 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us? Nephren is playing a game with little leprechauns. She gives them an infinite array of strings,  f 0... \u221e . f 0  is \" What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy?
