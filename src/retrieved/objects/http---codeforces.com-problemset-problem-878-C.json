The sportsman with higher powers always wins. It's guaranteed that for any kind of sport all of these powers are distinct. Output For each of the  n  tournaments output the number of contenders who can win. Examples Input 3 2 1 5 5 1 10 10 Output 1 2 1 Input 3 2 2 2 3 3 1 10 Output 1 1 3 Input 3 2 2 3 1 1 3 2 Output 1 1 2 Note In the first sample: In the first tournament there is only one sportsman, and he is the winner. In the second tournament, there are two sportsmen, and everyone can defeat another, depending on kind of sports. In the third tournament, the third sportsman in the strongest in both kinds of sports, so he is the winner regardless of the scheme."}
