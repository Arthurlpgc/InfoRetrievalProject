Chef has been tasked with reporting on the procession, and for this he decides to first keep track of all the snakes. When he sees a snake first, it'll be its Head, and hence he will mark a 'H'. The snakes are long, and when he sees the snake finally slither away, he'll mark a 'T' to denote its tail. In the time in between, when the snake is moving past him, or the time between one snake and the next snake, he marks with '.'s. Because the snakes come in a procession, and one by one, a valid report would be something like \"..H..T...HTH....T.\", or \"...\", or \"HT\", whereas \"T...H..H.T\", \"H..T..H\", \"H..H..T..T\" would be invalid reports (See explanations at the bottom). Formally, a snake is represented by a 'H' followed by some (possibly zero) '.'s, and then a 'T'. A valid report is one such that it begins with a (possibly zero length) string of '.'s, and then some (possibly zero) snakes between which there can be some '.'s, and then finally ends with some (possibly zero) '.'s.\n Chef had binged on the festival food and had been very drowsy. So his report might be invalid. You need to help him find out if his report is valid or not. \"H..H..T..T\" is invalid because the second snake starts before the first snake ends, which is not allowed. \".T...H..H.T\" is invalid because it has a 'T' before a 'H'. A tail can come only after its head. \"H..T..H\" is invalid because the last 'H' does not have a corresponding 'T'.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
