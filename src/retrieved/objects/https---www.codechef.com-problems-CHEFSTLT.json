The strings on both the sheets have equal lengths. However, since the sheets are very old, some letters have become unreadable. Chef would like to estimate the  difference  between these strings. Let's assume that the first string is named  S1 , and the second  S2 . The unreadable symbols are specified with the question mark symbol '?'. The  difference  between the strings equals to the number of positions  i , such that  S1 i  is not equal to  S2 i , where  S1 i  and  S2 i  denote the symbol at the  i  the position in  S1  and  S2 , respectively. Chef would like to know the minimal and the maximal difference between the two strings, if he changes all unreadable symbols to lowercase Latin letters. Now that you're fully aware of Chef's programming expertise, you might have guessed that he needs you help solving this problem as well. Go on, help him! The first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. The description of  T  test cases follows. The first line of a test case contains a string  S1 . The second line of a test case contains a string  S2 .  Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters and question marks in places where the symbols are unreadable. For each test case, output the minimal and the maximal difference between two given strings separated with a single space. \n 1  \u2264  T  \u2264  100 \n 1  \u2264  |S1|, |S2|  \u2264  100 \n Subtask 1 (25 points):  |S1| = 1 \n Subtask 2 (10 points): neither  S1  nor  S2  contains unreadable symbols \n Subtask 3 (65 points):  1  \u2264  |S1|, |S2|  \u2264  100 \n Example case 1 . You can change the question marks in the strings so that you obtain  S1  = abc and  S2  = abb. Then  S1  and  S2  will differ in one position. On the other hand, you can change the letters so that  S1  = abc and  S2  = bab. Then, the strings will differ in all three positions. Example case 2 . Change the question marks this way:  S1  = dcba,  S2  = dcba, then the strings will differ in  0  positions. You can also change the question marks so that  S1  = aaaa,  S2  = dcba, then the strings will differ in  3  positions. Example case 3 . Change the question marks this way:  S1  = aabac,  S2  = abaaw, then the strings will differ in  3  positions. Then, change the question marks this way:  S1  = xabac,  S2  = abayw, then they will differ in  5  positions.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
