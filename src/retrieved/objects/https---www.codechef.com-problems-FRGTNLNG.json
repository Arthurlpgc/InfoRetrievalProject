Such languages were, probably, widely used before and no one could have ever imagined that they will become extinct at some point. Unfortunately, that is what happened to them. On the happy side of things, a language may be dead, but some of its words may continue to be used in other languages.\n \nUsing something called as  the Internet , you have acquired a dictionary of  N  words of a forgotten language. Meanwhile, you also know  K  phrases used in modern languages. For each of the words of the forgotten language, your task is to determine whether the word is still in use in any of these  K  modern phrases or not.\n \nThe first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. The description of  T  test cases follows.\n \nThe first line of a test case description contains two space separated positive integers  N  and  K .\n \nThe second line of the description contains  N  strings denoting a dictionary of the forgotten language.\n \nEach of the next  K  lines of the description starts with one positive integer  L  denoting the number of words in the corresponding phrase in modern languages. The integer is followed by  L  strings (not necessarily distinct) denoting the phrase.\n For each test case, output a single line containing  N  tokens (space-separated): if the  i th  word of the dictionary exists in at least one phrase in modern languages, then you should output  YES  as the  i th  token, otherwise  NO .    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
