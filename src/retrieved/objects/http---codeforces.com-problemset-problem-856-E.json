The line  AB  is the edge of the universe, so one of the half-planes contains nothing, neither the planet, nor RCC satellites, nor anything else.

To create a communication channel a repeater is required. It must not be located inside the planet, but can be located at its half-circle border, or above it.

No two satellites that simultaneously exist can occupy the same point. Distance from each satellite to the center of the planet is strictly greater than  r .
