Forbidden Indices time limit per test 2 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output You are given a string  s  consisting of  n  lowercase Latin letters. Some indices in this string are marked as  forbidden . You want to find a string  a  such that the value of  | a |\u00b7 f ( a )  is maximum possible, where  f ( a )  is the number of occurences of  a  in  s  such that these occurences end in non-forbidden indices. So, for example, if  s  is  aaaa ,  a  is  aa  and index  3  is forbidden, then  f ( a )\u2009=\u20092  because there are three occurences of  a  in  s  (starting in indices  1 ,  2  and  3 ), but one of them (starting in index  2 ) ends in a forbidden index. Calculate the maximum possible value of  | a |\u00b7 f ( a )  you can get.
