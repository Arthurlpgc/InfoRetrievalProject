Petya and Catacombs time limit per test 1 second memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output A very brave explorer Petya once decided to explore Paris catacombs. Since Petya is not really experienced, his exploration is just walking through the catacombs. Catacombs consist of several rooms and bidirectional passages between some pairs of them. Some passages can connect a room to itself and since the passages are built on different depths they do not intersect each other. Every minute Petya arbitrary chooses a passage from the room he is currently in and then reaches the room on the other end of the passage in exactly one minute. When he enters a room at minute  i , he makes a note in his logbook with number  t i :     If Petya has visited this room before, he writes down the minute he was in this room last time;   Otherwise, Petya writes down an arbitrary non-negative integer strictly less than current minute  i .
