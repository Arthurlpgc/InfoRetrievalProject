In this game, a map is a 2D rectangle of dimensions  N \u00d7 M  tiles. Initially, the tile at row  i  and column  j  has a height of  H i,j . Heights are always integers. Before creating the map, Chef first wants to make the heights of all the tiles equal. But he can only change height values using the  equalize  tool. The equalize tool is rectangular in shape, with dimensions  K \u00d7 L , and upon application, it replaces the height values of all the affected cells by their  median . The equalize tool cannot be rotated. For example, in the following  5 \u00d7 9  grid of heights: Suppose the dimensions of the equalize tool is  3 \u00d7 7 , and we apply it in the middle  3 \u00d7 7  region. The median of the values in that region is  3 , so after application, the grid becomes: Note that  K  and  L  are odd integers, so that the median is always an integer. Chef wants to make all height values equal by repeatedly applying the equalize tool. Furthermore, he also wants the final (common) height to be as large as possible. What is the maximum final (common) height that he can obtain? Furthermore, you have to answer  Q  queries, where each query denotes a different set of values for  K  and  L . The first line of input contains three integers,  N ,  M ,  Q . The following  N  lines describe the height values. Each line contains  M  integers. The  j th  value in the  i th  line contains  H i,j . The following  Q  lines describe the queries. The  j th  line contains two integers,  K j  and  L j . For each query, output a single integer, the maximum final (common) height that Chef can obtain, assuming the size of the equalize tool is  K j  \u00d7 L j . In the first query, Chef can obtain a final height of  8  by first applying the equalizer on the leftmost  3 \u00d7 3  region: then the rightmost  3 \u00d7 3  region: and then finally the middlemost  3 \u00d7 3  region: It can be shown that this is the largest final height that can be obtained.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
