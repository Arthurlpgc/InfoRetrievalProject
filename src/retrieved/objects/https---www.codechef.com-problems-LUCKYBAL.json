The Little Elephant calls some string  T  of the length  M   balanced  if there exists at least one integer  X  ( 1 \u2264 X \u2264 M ) such that the number of digits  4  in the substring  T[1, X - 1]  is equal to the number of digits  7  in the substring  T[X, M] . For example, the string  S = 7477447  is balanced since  S[1, 4] = 7477  has 1 digit  4  and  S[5, 7] = 447  has 1 digit  7 . On the other hand, one can verify that the string  S = 7  is not balanced.  The Little Elephant has the string  S  of the length  N . He wants to know the number of such pairs of integers  (L; R)  that  1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N  and the substring  S[L, R]   is balanced. Help him to find this number. Notes. Let  S  be some lucky string. Then The first line of the input file contains a single integer  T , the number of test cases. Each of the following  T  lines contains one string, the string  S  for the corresponding test case. The input file does not contain any whitespaces. For each test case output a single line containing the answer for this test case.  1 \u2264  T  \u2264 10\n  1 \u2264  |S|  \u2264 100000\n   S  consists only of the lucky digits  4  and  7 . In the first test case balance substrings are  S[1, 1] = 4  and  S[1, 2] = 47 . In the second test case balance substrings are  S[2, 2] = 4  and  S[1, 2] = 74 . Unfortunately, we can't provide you with the explanations of the third and the fourth test cases. You should figure it out by yourself. Please, don't ask about this in comments.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
