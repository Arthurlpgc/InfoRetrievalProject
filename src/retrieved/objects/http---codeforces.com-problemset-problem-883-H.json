Palindromic Cut time limit per test 3 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output Kolya has a string  s  of length  n  consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and digits. He wants to rearrange the symbols in  s  and cut it into the minimum number of parts so that each part is a palindrome and all parts have  the same lengths . A palindrome is a string which reads the same backward as forward, such as  madam  or  racecar . Your task is to help Kolya and determine the minimum number of palindromes of equal lengths to cut  s  into, if it is allowed to rearrange letters in  s  before cuttings. Input The first line contains an integer  n  ( 1\u2009\u2264\u2009 n \u2009\u2264\u20094\u00b710 5 ) \u2014 the length of string  s . The second line contains a string  s  of length  n  consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and digits. Output Print to the first line an integer  k  \u2014 minimum number of palindromes into which you can cut a given string. Print to the second line  k  strings \u2014 the palindromes themselves. Separate them by a space. You are allowed to print palindromes in arbitrary order. All of them should have the same length.
