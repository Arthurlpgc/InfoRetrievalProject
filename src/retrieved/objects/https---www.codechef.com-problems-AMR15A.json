The kingdom of Maahishmati had never lost a battle under him (as army-chief), and the reason for that was their really powerful army, also called as  Mahasena . Kattapa was known to be a very superstitious person. He believed that a soldier is \"lucky\" if the soldier is holding an  even number  of weapons, and \"unlucky\" otherwise. He considered the army as \"READY FOR BATTLE\" if the count of \"lucky\" soldiers is strictly greater than the count of \"unlucky\" soldiers, and \"NOT READY\" otherwise. Given the number of weapons each soldier is holding, your task is to determine whether the army formed by all these soldiers is \"READY FOR BATTLE\" or \"NOT READY\". Note : You can find the definition of an even number  here . \nThe first line of input consists of a single integer  N  denoting the number of soldiers. The second line of input consists of  N  space separated integers  A 1 ,  A 2 , ...,  A N , where  A i  denotes the number of weapons that the  i th  soldier is holding. Generate one line output saying \"READY FOR BATTLE\", if the army satisfies the conditions that Kattapa requires or \"NOT READY\" otherwise (quotes for clarity). \n Example 1 : For the first example,  N = 1  and the array  A = [1] . There is only 1 soldier and he is holding 1 weapon, which is odd. The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 0, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 1. Hence, the answer is \"NOT READY\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. \n \n Example 2 : For the second example,  N = 1  and the array  A = [2] . There is only 1 soldier and he is holding 2 weapons, which is even. The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 1, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 0. Hence, the answer is \"READY FOR BATTLE\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. \n \n Example 3 : For the third example,  N = 4  and the array  A = [11, 12, 13, 14] . The 1 st  soldier is holding 11 weapons (which is odd), the 2 nd  soldier is holding 12 weapons (which is even), the 3 rd  soldier is holding 13 weapons (which is odd), and the 4 th  soldier is holding 14 weapons (which is even). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 2. Notice that we have an  equal  number of people holding even number of weapons and odd number of weapons. The answer here is \"NOT READY\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is  not strictly greater than  the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. \n \n Example 4 : For the fourth example,  N = 3  and the array  A = [2, 3, 4] . The 1 st  soldier is holding 2 weapons (which is even), the 2 nd  soldier is holding 3 weapons (which is odd), and the 3 rd  soldier is holding 4 weapons (which is even). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 1. Hence, the answer is \"READY FOR BATTLE\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. \n \n Example 5 : For the fifth example,  N = 5  and the array  A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . The 1 st  soldier is holding 1 weapon (which is odd), the 2 nd  soldier is holding 2 weapons (which is even), the 3 rd  soldier is holding 3 weapons (which is odd), the 4 th  soldier is holding 4 weapons (which is even), and the 5 th  soldier is holding 5 weapons (which is odd). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 3. Hence, the answer is \"NOT READY\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons. \n        Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
