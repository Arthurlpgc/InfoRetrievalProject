They cross a big highway in the car to reach to the school. Sebi sits in front seat beside his father at driving seat. To kill boredom, they play a game of guessing speed of other cars on the highway. Sebi makes a guess of other car's speed being  SG  kph, his father  FG  kph. \n The highway is usually empty, so the drivers use cruise control, i.e. vehicles run at a constant speed. There are markers on the highway at a gap of 50 meters. Both father-son duo wants to check the accuracy of their guesses. For that, they start a timer at the instant at which their car and the other car (which speed they are guessing) are parallel to each other (they need not to be against some marker, they can be in between the markers too). After some  T  seconds, they observe that both the cars are next to some markers and the number of markers in between the markers of their car and the other car is  D - 1  (excluding the markers next to both the cars). Also, they can observe these markers easily because the other car is faster than their. Speed of Sebi's father's car is  S . Using this information, one can find the speed of the other car accurately.\n \nAn example situation when Sebi's father starts the timer. Notice that both the car's are parallel to each other. \n \n \nExample situation after  T  seconds. The cars are next to the markers. Here the value of  D  is 1. The green car is Sebi's and the other car is of blue color. \n \n \nSebi's a child, he does not know how to find the check whose guess is close to the real speed of the car. He does not trust his father as he thinks that he might cheat. Can you help to resolve this issue between them by telling whose guess is closer. If Sebi's guess is better, output \"SEBI\". If his father's guess is better, output \"FATHER\". If both the guess are equally close, then output \"DRAW\".\n The first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases.  Each of the next  T  lines contain five space separated integers  S, SG, FG, D, T  corresponding to the Sebi's car speed, Sebi's guess, his father's guess,  D  as defined in the statement and the time at which both the cars at against the markers (in seconds), respectively. Output description. For each test case, output a single line containing \"SEBI\", \"FATHER\" or \"DRAW\" (without quotes) denoting whose guess is better. Example case 1. There are total  20 - 1 = 19  markers in between the Sebi's car and the other car. So, the distance between those cars at time  T  is 20 * 50 = 1000 meters = 1 km. As  T = 60  seconds, i.e. 1 minutes. So, the other car goes 1 km more than Sebi's car in 1 minute. So, the other car will go 60 km more than Sebi's car in 1 hour. So, its speed is 60 kmph more than Sebi's car, i.e. 160 kmph. Sebi had made a guess of 180 kmph, while his father of 200 kmph. Other car's real speed is 160 kmph. So, Sebi's guess is better than his father. Hence he wins the game. Example case 2. \n The situation of this example is depicted in the image provided in the statement. You can find the speed of other car and see that Father's guess is more accurate.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
