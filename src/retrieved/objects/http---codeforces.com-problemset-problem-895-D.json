String Mark time limit per test 4 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output At the Byteland State University marks are strings of the same length. Mark  x  is considered better than  y  if string  y  is lexicographically smaller than  x . Recently at the BSU was an important test work on which Vasya recived the mark  a . It is very hard for the teacher to remember the exact mark of every student, but he knows the mark  b , such that every student recieved mark strictly smaller than  b . Vasya isn't satisfied with his mark so he decided to improve it. He can swap characters in the string corresponding to his mark as many times as he like. Now he want to know only the number of different ways to improve his mark so that his teacher didn't notice something suspicious. More formally: you are given two strings  a ,  b  of the same length and you need to figure out the number of different strings  c  such that: 1)  c  can be obtained from  a  by swapping some characters, in other words  c  is a permutation of  a . 2) String  a  is lexicographically smaller than  c . 3) String  c  is lexicographically smaller than  b . For two strings  x  and  y  of the same length it is true that  x  is lexicographically smaller than  y  if there exists such  i , that  x 1 \u2009=\u2009 y 1 ,\u2009 x 2 \u2009=\u2009 y 2 ,\u2009...,\u2009 x i \u2009-\u20091 \u2009=\u2009 y i \u2009-\u20091 ,\u2009 x i \u2009<\u2009 y i .

Strings  a ,\u2009 b  consist of lowercase English letters. Their lengths are equal and don't exceed  10 6 . It is guaranteed that  a  is lexicographically smaller than  b . Output Print one integer \u00a0\u2014 the number of different strings satisfying the condition of the problem modulo  10 9 \u2009+\u20097 . Examples Input abc ddd Output 5 Input abcdef abcdeg Output 0 Input abacaba ubuduba Output 64 Note In first sample from string  abc  can be obtained strings  acb ,\u2009 bac ,\u2009 bca ,\u2009 cab ,\u2009 cba , all of them are larger than  abc , but smaller than  ddd . So the answer is  5 . In second sample any string obtained from  abcdef  is larger than  abcdeg . So the answer is  0 . D.

String Mark time limit per test 4 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output At the Byteland State University marks are strings of the same length. Mark  x  is considered better than  y  if string  y  is lexicographically smaller than  x . Recently at the BSU was an important test work on which Vasya recived the mark  a . It is very hard for the teacher to remember the exact mark of every student, but he knows the mark  b , such that every student recieved mark strictly smaller than  b . Vasya isn't satisfied with his mark so he decided to improve it. He can swap characters in the string corresponding to his mark as many times as he like. Now he want to know only the number of different ways to improve his mark so that his teacher didn't notice something suspicious. More formally: you are given two strings  a ,  b  of the same length and you need to figure out the number of different strings  c  such that: 1)  c  can be obtained from  a  by swapping some characters, in other words  c  is a permutation of  a . 2) String  a  is lexicographically smaller than  c . 3) String  c  is lexicographically smaller than  b . For two strings  x  and  y  of the same length it is true that  x  is lexicographically smaller than  y  if there exists such  i , that  x 1 \u2009=\u2009 y 1 ,\u2009 x 2 \u2009=\u2009 y 2 ,\u2009...,\u2009 x i \u2009-\u20091 \u2009=\u2009 y i \u2009-\u20091 ,\u2009 x i \u2009<\u2009 y i . Since the answer can be very large, you need to find answer modulo  10 9 \u2009+\u20097 . Input First line contains string  a , second line contains string  b . Strings  a ,\u2009 b  consist of lowercase English letters. Their lengths are equal and don't exceed  10 6 . It is guaranteed that  a  is lexicographically smaller than  b . Output Print one integer \u00a0\u2014 the number of different strings satisfying the condition of the problem modulo  10 9 \u2009+\u20097 . Examples Input abc ddd Output 5 Input abcdef abcdeg Output 0 Input abacaba ubuduba Output 64 Note In first sample from string  abc  can be obtained strings  acb ,\u2009 bac ,\u2009 bca ,\u2009 cab ,\u2009 cba , all of them are larger than  abc , but smaller than  ddd . So the answer is  5 . In second sample any string obtained from  abcdef  is larger than  abcdeg . So the answer is  0 . D.
