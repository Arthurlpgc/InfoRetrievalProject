Hogwarts' entrance can be imagined as a straight line (x-axis) from  1  to  10 5 . Nagini is launching various snakes at the Hogwarts entrance. Each snake lands parallel to the entrance, covering a segment at a distance  k  from  x \u2009=\u2009 l  to  x \u2009=\u2009 r .

Danger value for a segment  [ l ,\u2009 r )  of the entrance can be calculated by taking the sum of danger values for each integer  x -coordinate present in the segment. Formally, you have to implement two types of queries:     1 l r k : a snake is added parallel to entrance from  x \u2009=\u2009 l  to  x \u2009=\u2009 r  at y-coordinate  y \u2009=\u2009 k  ( l  inclusive,  r  exclusive).    2 l r : you have to calculate the danger value of segment  l  to  r  ( l  inclusive,  r  exclusive).  Input First line of input contains a single integer  q  ( 1\u2009\u2264\u2009 q \u2009\u2264\u20095\u00b710 4 ) denoting the number of queries. Next  q  lines each describe a query. Each query description first contains the query type  type i  ( 1\u2009\u2264\u2009 type i \u2009\u2264\u20092 ). This is followed by further description of the query. In case of the type being  1 , it is followed by integers  l i ,\u2009 r i  and  k i  ( ,  \u2009-\u200910 9 \u2009\u2264\u2009 k i \u2009\u2264\u200910 9 ,  k \u2009\u2260\u20090 ). Otherwise, it just contains two integers,  l i  and  r i  ( 1\u2009\u2264\u2009 l i \u2009<\u2009 r i \u2009\u2264\u200910 5 ). Output Output the answer for each query of type 2 in a separate line. Examples Input 3 1 1 10 10 1 2 4 -7 2 1 10 Output 34 Input 7 1 2 3 5 1 1 10 10 1 4 5 -5 2 4 8 1 1 10 -10 2 4 8 2 1 10 Output 15 75 170 Note In the first sample case, the danger value for  x -coordinates  1  is  0  as there is no  y 2  satisfying the above condition for  x \u2009=\u20091 . Danger values for  x -coordinates  2  and  3  is  10\u2009+\u2009|\u2009-\u20097|\u2009=\u200917 . Danger values for  x -coordinates  4  to  9  is again  0  as there is no  y 2  satisfying the above condition for these coordinates. Thus, total danger value is  17\u2009+\u200917\u2009=\u200934 . F. Nagini time limit per test 4 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output Nagini, being a horcrux You-know-who created with the murder of Bertha Jorkins, has accumulated its army of snakes and is launching an attack on Hogwarts school.  Hogwarts' entrance can be imagined as a straight line (x-axis) from  1  to  10 5 . Nagini is launching various snakes at the Hogwarts entrance. Each snake lands parallel to the entrance, covering a segment at a distance  k  from  x \u2009=\u2009 l  to  x \u2009=\u2009 r . Formally, each snake can be imagined as being a line segment between points  ( l ,\u2009 k )  and  ( r ,\u2009 k ) . Note that  k  can be both positive and negative, but not  0 . Let, at some  x -coordinate  x \u2009=\u2009 i , there be snakes at point  ( i ,\u2009 y 1 )  and point  ( i ,\u2009 y 2 ) , such that  y 1 \u2009>\u20090  and  y 2 \u2009<\u20090 . Then, if for any point  ( i ,\u2009 y 3 )  containing a snake such that  y 3 \u2009>\u20090 ,  y 1 \u2009\u2264\u2009 y 3  holds and for any point  ( i ,\u2009 y 4 )  containing a snake such that  y 4 \u2009<\u20090 ,  | y 2 |\u2009\u2264\u2009| y 4 |  holds, then the danger value at coordinate  x \u2009=\u2009 i  is  y 1 \u2009+\u2009| y 2 | . If no such  y 1  and  y 2  exist, danger value is  0 .  Harry wants to calculate the danger value of various segments of the Hogwarts entrance.
