He starts his day with cooking food, then he eats the food and finally proceeds for sleeping thus ending his day. Chef carries a robot as his personal assistant whose job is to log the activities of Chef at various instants during the day.  Today  it recorded activities that Chef was doing at N different instants. These instances are recorded in chronological order (in increasing order of time). This log is provided to you in form of a string  s  of length N, consisting of characters 'C', 'E' and 'S'. If  s [i] = 'C', then it means that at the i-th instant Chef was cooking, 'E' denoting he was eating and 'S' means he was sleeping. You have to tell whether the record log made by the robot could possibly be correct or not.  The first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. The description of  T  test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains string  s . For each test case, output a single line containing \"yes\" or \"no\" (without quotes) accordingly. Example case 1.  \"CES\" can correspond to a possible record of activities of Chef. He starts the day with cooking, then eating and then sleeping. Example case 2.  \"CS\" can also correspond to a possible record of activities of Chef. He starts the day with cooking, then eating and then sleeping. Robot recorded his cooking and sleeping in order. He might not have recorded his eating activity. Example case 4.  \"SC\" can not correspond to Chef's activities. Here it means that Chef slept first, then he cooked the food, which is impossible for Chef to do on some particular day.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
