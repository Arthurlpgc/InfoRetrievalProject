We may call it No. 68 Cinema. However, one day, the No. 68 Cinema runs out of changes (they don't have 50- yuan  notes currently), but Nephren still wants to start their business. (Assume that  yuan  is a kind of currency in Regulu Ere.) There are three types of customers: some of them bring exactly a 50- yuan  note; some of them bring a 100- yuan  note and Nephren needs to give a 50- yuan  note back to him/her; some of them bring VIP cards so that they don't need to pay for the ticket. Now  n  customers are waiting outside in queue. Nephren wants to know how many possible queues are there that they are able to run smoothly (i.e. every customer can receive his/her change), and that the number of 50- yuan  notes they have after selling tickets to all these customers is between  l  and  r , inclusive.
