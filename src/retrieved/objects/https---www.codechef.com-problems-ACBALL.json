One day, he was playing with them. During the play, he arranged the balls into two rows both consisting of  N  number of balls. These two rows of balls are given to you in the form of strings  X, Y . Both these string consist of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white colored ball and 'B' a black colored.\n Other than these two rows of balls, Akhil has an infinite supply of extra balls of each color. he wants to create another row of  N  balls,  Z  in such a way that the sum of hamming distance between  X  and  Z , and hamming distance between  Y  and  Z  is maximized. Hamming Distance  between two strings  X  and  Y  is defined as the number of positions where the color of balls in row  X  differs from the row  Y  ball at that position. e.g. hamming distance between \"WBB\", \"BWB\" is 2, as at position 1 and 2, corresponding colors in the two strings differ. As there can be multiple such arrangements of row  Z , Akhil wants you to find the lexicographically smallest arrangement which will maximize the above value. \n Example case 1.  As we know, Hamming Distance(WBWB, BWBW) + Hamming Distance(WBBB, BWBW) = 4 + 3 = 7.\nYou can try any other value for string  Z , it will never exceed 6.     Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
