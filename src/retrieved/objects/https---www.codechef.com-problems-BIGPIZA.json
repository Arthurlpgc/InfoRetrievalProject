Having read this fact on internet, two chefs from the Elephant city, Arjuna and Bhima are set to make pizza popular in India. They organized a social awareness camp, where  N  people ( other than these two ) sit around a large pizza. To make it more interesting, they make some pairs among these N people and the two persons in a pair, feed each other.\n Each person should be a part of at most one pair and most importantly, to make feeding easy, any two pairs should not cross each other ( see figure for more clarity ). Arjuna and Bhima decided to play a game on making the pairs. In his turn, a player makes a pair ( selects two persons, as long as its valid ) and this pair start feeding each other. Arjuna and Bhima take turns alternately, by making a pair in each turn, and they  play optimally ( see Notes for more clarity ). The one who can not make a pair in his turn, loses. Given N, find who wins the game, if Arjuna starts first.  \n  First line contains an integer T ( number of test cases, around 1000 ). Each of the next T lines contains an integer N ( 2 <= N <= 10000 ) For each test case, output the name of the winner ( either \"Arjuna\" or \"Bhima\" ( without quotes ) ) in a new line. \n Explanation: Let the people around the table are numbered 1, 2, ... , N in clock-wise order as shown in the image  Case 1 : N = 2. Only two persons and Arjuna makes the only possible pair (1,2) Case 2 : N = 4. Arjuna can make the pair (1,3). Bhima can not make any more pairs ( without crossing the pair (1,3) ) Case 3 : N = 5. No matter which pair Arjuna makes first, Bhima can always make one more pair, and Arjuna can not make any further    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
