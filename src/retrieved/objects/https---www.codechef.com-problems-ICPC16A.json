It wants to reach its home as soon as possible. Currently it is standing at coordinates  (x 1 , y 1 )  in 2-D plane. Its home is at coordinates  (x 2 , y 2 ) . Bunny is extremely worried. Please help it by giving a command by telling the direction in which it should to go so as to reach its home. If you give it a direction, it will keep moving in that direction till it reaches its home. There are four possible directions you can give as command -  \"left\", \"right\", \"up\", \"down\" . It might be possible that you can't instruct the robot in such a way that it reaches its home. In that case, output  \"sad\" .\n First line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases.  T  test cases follow. First line of each test case contains four space separated integers  x 1 , y 1 , x 2 , y 2 . For each test case, output a single line containing  \"left\"  or  \"right\"  or  \"up\"  or  \"down\"  or  \"sad\"  (without quotes). Test case 1.  If you give Bunny the command to move to the right, it will reach its home.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
