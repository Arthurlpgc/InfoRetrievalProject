A game is played on these piles, in order from pile  1  to  N . When the game is on the i-th pile, a player can remove any non-zero number of stones from this pile in a single move. If the current pile becomes empty, the game moves on to the next pile. The player who is unable to make a move loses. Srijan and Ankit are going to play this game. Ankit, being younger, always gets to start the game. However, Srijan, being clever, sneaks into the game arena early and permutes the order of piles. Then, the game is played on this new order of piles. Your task is to find out the number of orders in which the piles can be arranged so that Ankit wins the game. Assume that both the players play optimally. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo  10 9  + 7 . Note that two orders are considered different if their contents are different. Formally, two orders A and B are different if there exists an index  k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 N ) such that  A k  != B k . For each test case, output a single integer corresponding to the answer for that test case. Sample input: \n Sample Output: \n Explanation: \n Case 1: \nThe following different orders are possible:  \n [1, 1, 2] \nAnkit removes the only stone in the first pile. \nSrijan removes the only stone in the second pile. \nAnkit removes both the stones in the second pile. \nAnkit wins.  \n [1, 2, 1] \nAnkit removes the only stone in the first pile. \nSrijan takes one stone from then the second pile. Ankit removes the remaining one stone from the second pile. \nSrijan removes the only stone in the third pile. \nSrijan wins. [2, 1, 1] \nAnkit removes both the stones in the first pile. \nSrijan removes the only stone in the second pile. \nAnkit removes the only stone in the second pile. \nAnkit wins. Thus, Ankit wins on 2 different orders.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
