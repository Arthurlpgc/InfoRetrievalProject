These transceivers form the areas called  cells  (this term gave the name to the cellular phone) and every phone connects to the BTS with the strongest signal (in a little simplified view). Of course, BTSes need some attention and technicians need to check their function periodically.\n The technicians faced a very interesting problem recently. Given a set of BTSes to visit, they needed to find the shortest path to visit all of the given points and return back to the central company building. Programmers have spent several months studying this problem but with no results. They were unable to find the solution fast enough. After a long time, one of the programmers found this problem in a conference article. Unfortunately, he found that the problem is so called \"Traveling Salesman Problem\" and it is very hard to solve. If we have  N  BTSes to be visited, we can visit them in any order, giving us  N ! possibilities to examine. The function expressing that number is called factorial and can be computed as a product \n1.2.3.4.... N . The number is very high even for a relatively small  N . The programmers understood they had no chance to solve the problem. But because they have already received the research grant from the government, they needed to continue with their studies and produce at least  some  results. So they started to study behavior of the factorial function. For example, they defined the function  Z . For any positive integer  N ,  Z ( N ) is the number of zeros at the end of the decimal form of number  N !. They noticed that this function never decreases. If we have two numbers  N 1 < N 2, then   Z ( N 1 ) <=  Z ( N 2). It is because we can never \"lose\" any \ntrailing zero by multiplying by any positive number. We can only get new and new zeros. The function  Z  is very interesting, so we need a computer program that can determine its value efficiently. There is a single positive integer  T  on the first line of input (equal to about 100000). It stands for the number of numbers to follow. Then there are  T  lines, each containing exactly one positive integer number  N , 1 <=  N  <= 1000000000. For every number  N , output a single line containing the single non-negative integer  Z ( N ).

After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
