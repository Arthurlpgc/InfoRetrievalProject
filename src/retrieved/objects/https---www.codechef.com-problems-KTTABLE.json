Each of them sometimes wants to use the kitchen, so the head of the dormitory came up with a timetable for kitchen's usage in order to avoid the conflicts:\n \n The first student starts to use the kitchen at the time  0  and should finish the cooking not later than at the time  A 1 . \n The second student starts to use the kitchen at the time  A 1  and should finish the cooking not later than at the time  A 2 . \n And so on. \n The  N -th student starts to use the kitchen at the time  A N-1  and should finish the cooking not later than at the time  A N \n \n The holidays in Berland are approaching, so today each of these  N  students wants to cook some pancakes. The  i -th student needs  B i  units of time to cook. The students have understood that probably not all of them will be able to cook everything they want. How many students will be able to cook without violating the schedule? The first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. The description of  T  test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer  N  denoting the number of students. The second line contains  N  space-separated integers  A 1 ,  A 2 , ...,  A N  denoting the moments of time by when the corresponding student should finish cooking.  The third line contains  N  space-separated integers  B 1 ,  B 2 , ...,  B N  denoting the time required for each of the students to cook. For each test case, output a single line containing the number of students that will be able to finish the cooking. Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like: Example case 1.  The first student has  1  unit of time - the moment  0 . It will be enough for her to cook. The second student has  9  units of time, but wants to cook for  10  units of time, and won't fit in time. The third student has  5  units of time and will fit in time, because needs to cook only for  3  units of time. Example case 2.  Each of students has  10  units of time, but only the second one will be able to fit in time.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
