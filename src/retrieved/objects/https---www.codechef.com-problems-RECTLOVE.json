Kark is infatuated with Ayvak. He offers to play a game with Thik. Whosoever wins, will get to marry Ayvak. Ayvak, who values games of chance over all the other things in life, agrees to this.\n \nKark sets up an  N  by  M  grid ( N  rows,  M  columns), labelled from left to right and top to bottom consecutively with numbers from 1 to M*N, with 1 at the top left corner and M*N at the bottom right corner. For example, a labelled 3 by 6 grid looks as follows: \n \n Kark has already painted  K  unit squares of the grid with a heart each. Next, Thik randomly picks a rectangle with sides on the grid lines, and having a positive area, with each valid rectangle having an equal probability of being chosen. Three distinct possibilities for Thik's rectangle in the 3 by 6 grid are shown below:  \n \n \n \n The first line of input contains one integer  T , the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains 3 space-separated integers  N, M, K , as described in the problem statement. The next line contains  K  space-separated integers, each a single number from  1  to  M*N , representing a square that is painted with a heart. It is guaranteed that all  K  integers are distinct. Output  T  lines, each containing a single real number, containing the expected number of hearts that a randomly chosen rectangle will contain. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error does not exceed 10 -6 .\n There are a total of 9 possible rectangles Thik could draw, shown in the figure above, and grid squares 1 and 2 are painted with a heart. The top row of possible selections (shown in the figure) contain 1, 0, 1, 2, and 2 hearts (from left to right), and the bottom row of possible selections (in the figure) contain 1, 0, 1, and 0 hearts. Therefore, 3/9 of the time 0 hearts are contained in the rectangle, 4/9 of the times 1 heart is contained in the rectangle, and 2/9 of the time 2 hearts are contained in the rectangle. The expected value is then 0 * 3/9 + 1 * 4/9 + 2 * 2/9 = 8/9.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
