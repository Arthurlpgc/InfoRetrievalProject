To be more specific, a  complete binary tree  with  n  nodes numbered from  1  to  n . The node numbered  1  is the root, and the parent of the  i -th ( 2\u2009\u2264\u2009 i \u2009\u2264\u2009 n ) node is  . Note that, however, all edges in the tree are undirected. Koyomi adds  m  extra undirected edges to the tree, creating more complication to trick the bees. And you're here to count the number of  simple paths  in the resulting graph, modulo  10 9 \u2009+\u20097 . A  simple path  is an alternating sequence of adjacent nodes and undirected edges, which begins and ends with nodes and does not contain any node more than once.

To be more specific, a  complete binary tree  with  n  nodes numbered from  1  to  n . The node numbered  1  is the root, and the parent of the  i -th ( 2\u2009\u2264\u2009 i \u2009\u2264\u2009 n ) node is  . Note that, however, all edges in the tree are undirected. Koyomi adds  m  extra undirected edges to the tree, creating more complication to trick the bees. And you're here to count the number of  simple paths  in the resulting graph, modulo  10 9 \u2009+\u20097 . A  simple path  is an alternating sequence of adjacent nodes and undirected edges, which begins and ends with nodes and does not contain any node more than once. Do note that a single node is also considered a valid  simple path  under this definition. Please refer to the examples and notes below for instances.
