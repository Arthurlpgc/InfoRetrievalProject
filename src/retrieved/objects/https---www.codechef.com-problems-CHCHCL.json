More formally, chocolate is a rectangular plate consisting of  n  rows and  m  columns.  Here you can see an example of a standard 5 by 7 chocolate.   He has two friends and they will play with this chocolate. First friend takes the chocolate and cuts it into two parts by making either a horizontal or vertical cut. Then, the second friend takes one of the available pieces and divides into two parts by either making a horizontal or vertical cut. Then the turn of first friend comes and he can pick any block of the available chocolates and do the same thing again. The player who cannot make a turn loses.  Now Chef is interested in finding which of his friends will win if both of them play optimally. Output \"Yes\", if the friend who plays first will win, otherwise print \"No\". The first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. The description of  T  test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two space separated integers  n  and  m  - the sizes of the chocolate. For each test case, output a single line containing one word \"Yes\" (without quotes) if there is a sequence of moves leading to the winning of the person who moves first and \"No\" (without quotes) otherwise. Example case 1.  There is only one possible move, so the second player even won't have a chance to make move. Example case 2.  There are only two ways first player can make first move, after each of them only one move left, so the first player cannot win.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
