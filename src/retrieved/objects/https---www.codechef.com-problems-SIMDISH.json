Two dishes are called  similar  if at least half of their ingredients are the same.\nIn other words, at least two of four ingredients of the first dish should also be present in the second dish.\nThe order of ingredients doesn't matter. Your task is to examine  T  pairs of dishes.\nFor each pair, check if the two dishes are similar and print \"similar\" or \"dissimilar\" accordingly. The first line of the input contains an integer  T  denoting the number of test cases. The description of  T  test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains four distinct strings, denoting ingredients needed for the first dish.\nEach ingredient is represented by a string of length between 2 and 10 inclusive, consisting of lowercase English letters.\n The second line of each test case describes the second dish in the same format. For each test case, output a single line containing the answer \u2014 \"similar\" if at least half of the ingredients are same, and \"dissimilar\" otherwise (without the quotes). Test case 1.  The first dish consists of ingredients: eggs, sugar, flour, salt, while the second dish consists of: sugar, eggs, milk, flour. Three of four ingredients are present in both dishes (eggs, sugar, flour) so the two dishes are similar. Test case 2.  This example shows that strings in the input don't necessarily represent real food.\nThe answer is again \"similar\", because two ingredients are present in both dishes (\"ac\" and \"ad\"). Test case 3.  The only common ingredient is lemon, so the answer is \"dissimilar\".\nRemember that at least two ingredients should be present in both dishes.    Fetching successful submissions Program should read from  standard input  and write to  standard output .  After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
