Chef knows that Chhotu is very intelligent. So, Chef gives Chhotu a simple problem and wants him to solve this problem by today. The problem is as follows. There are  N  students in a classroom. The students are sitting in a single row. Chef wants that all the girls should sit in left side of the row and all the boys should sit in right side of the row. You are provided the initial row of the students by  N  binary integers, where if  i -th integer is zero, then it means that at the  i -th position, there is a boy, where  1  will mean girl. For example, if the initial arrangement be  [0 1 0 1 1] , then final arrangement should be  [1 1 1 0 0] . In a single second, if a boy finds that a girl is sitting to his immediate right i.e. if a boy is sitting at i th  position and a girl is sitting at (i+1) th  position then they swap their positions. For example, let the initial arrangement be  [0 1 0 1 1] . Boys are sitting at positions  1, 3  (1-based indexing) and girls are sitting at positions  2, 4, 5 . In a single second, boy at position 1 swaps his seat with girl at position  2 , and similarly boy at position  3  swaps his seat with girl at position 4. So, after one second, the arrangement becomes  [1 0 1 0 1] . Chhotu can solve this problem very easily but today he is very busy. Please help Chhotu to solve this problem. The first line of the input contains  T  denoting the number of test cases. The description of  T  test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer  N  denoting the number of students in the row. The second line contains  N  space-separated integers -  A 1 ,  A 2 , ...,  A N  denoting the initial arrangement of the students. For each test case, output a single integer on a new line corresponding to the number of seconds required such that all girls are to the left of boys.

After you submit a solution you can see your results by clicking on the  [My Submissions]  tab on the problem page. Below are the possible results: \u00a0 CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,  computer programming  and  programming contests . At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a  programming contest  at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to  algorithms, binary search , technicalities like  array size  and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for  programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of  computer programming .  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our  programming contest  judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple  programming challenges  that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.   Here is where you can show off your  computer programming  skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly  coding contest  and the shorter format Cook-off  coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our  programming contests  have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.  "}
