Input In first line there are 7 positive integers  n ,  a ,  b ,  c ,  d ,  start ,  len  ( 1\u2009\u2264\u2009 n \u2009\u2264\u20093\u00b710 5 ,  0\u2009\u2264\u2009 start \u2009\u2264\u200910 9 ,  1\u2009\u2264\u2009 a ,\u2009 b ,\u2009 c ,\u2009 d ,\u2009 len \u2009\u2264\u200910 9 ), where  n  is a number of fashion shows and photo shoots,  a ,  b ,  c  and  d  are rating changes described above,  start  is an initial rating of model and  len  is a duration of influence of talk show. In next  n  lines descriptions of events are given. Each of those lines contains two integers  t i  and  q i  ( 1\u2009\u2264\u2009 t i \u2009\u2264\u200910 9 ,  0\u2009\u2264\u2009 q \u2009\u2264\u20091 )\u00a0\u2014 moment, in which event happens and type of this event. Type 0 corresponds to the fashion show and type 1\u00a0\u2014 to photo shoot.  Events are given in order of increasing  t i , all  t i  are different. Output Print one non-negative integer  t \u00a0\u2014 the moment of time in which talk show should happen to make Izabella's rating non-negative before talk show and during period of influence of talk show. If there are multiple answers print smallest of them. If there are no such moments, print  \u2009-\u20091 .
