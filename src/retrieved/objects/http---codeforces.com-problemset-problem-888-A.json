Local Extrema time limit per test 1 second memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output You are given an array  a . Some element of this array  a i  is a  local minimum  iff it is strictly less than both of its neighbours (that is,  a i \u2009<\u2009 a i \u2009-\u20091  and  a i \u2009<\u2009 a i \u2009+\u20091 ).
