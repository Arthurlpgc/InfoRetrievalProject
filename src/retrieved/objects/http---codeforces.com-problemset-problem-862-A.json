Mahmoud and Ehab and the MEX time limit per test 2 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output Dr. Evil kidnapped Mahmoud and Ehab in the evil land because of their performance in the Evil Olympiad in Informatics (EOI). He decided to give them some problems to let them go. Dr. Evil is interested in sets, He has a set of  n  integers. Dr. Evil calls a set of integers  evil  if the  MEX  of it is exactly  x . the  MEX  of a set of integers is the minimum non-negative integer that doesn't exist in it. For example, the  MEX  of the set  {0,\u20092,\u20094}  is  1  and the  MEX  of the set  {1,\u20092,\u20093}  is  0  . Dr. Evil is going to make his set  evil . To do this he can perform some operations. During each operation he can add some non-negative integer to his set or erase some element from it. What is the minimal number of operations Dr. Evil has to perform to make his set  evil ? Input The first line contains two integers  n  and  x  ( 1\u2009\u2264\u2009 n \u2009\u2264\u2009100 ,  0\u2009\u2264\u2009 x \u2009\u2264\u2009100 )\u00a0\u2014 the size of the set Dr. Evil owns, and the desired  MEX . The second line contains  n  distinct non-negative integers not exceeding  100  that represent the set. Output The only line should contain one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimal number of operations Dr. Evil should perform. Examples Input 5 3 0 4 5 6 7 Output 2 Input 1 0 0 Output 1 Input 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 Output 0 Note For the first test case Dr. Evil should add  1  and  2  to the set performing  2  operations. For the second test case Dr. Evil should erase  0  from the set. After that, the set becomes empty, so the  MEX  of it is  0 . In the third test case the set is already  evil . A.
