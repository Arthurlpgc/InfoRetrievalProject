There can be more than one edges between two vertices. It's guaranteed that the given graph is connected.

MST with edges  (1,\u20093,\u20094,\u20096) , contains all of edges from the first query, so answer on the first query is \" YES \". Edges from the second query form a cycle of length  3 , so there is no spanning tree including these three edges. Thus, answer is \" NO \". C.
