Japanese Crosswords Strike Back time limit per test 1 second memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output A one-dimensional Japanese crossword can be represented as a binary string of length  x . An encoding of this crossword is an array  a  of size  n , where  n  is the number of segments formed completely of  1 's, and  a i  is the length of  i -th segment. No two segments touch or intersect. For example:     If  x \u2009=\u20096  and the crossword is  111011 , then its encoding is an array  {3,\u20092} ;   If  x \u2009=\u20098  and the crossword is  01101010 , then its encoding is an array  {2,\u20091,\u20091} ;   If  x \u2009=\u20095  and the crossword is  11111 , then its encoding is an array  {5} ;   If  x \u2009=\u20095  and the crossword is  00000 , then its encoding is an empty array.
