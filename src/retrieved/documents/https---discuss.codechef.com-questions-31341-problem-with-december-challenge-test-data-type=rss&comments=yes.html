Is anyone aware whether the test data format for December Challenge been changed? I am submitting code(s) in Java and they give runtime error (NZEC) on the judge page. In one of the questions, I changed the input mechanism from BufferedReader to custom InputReader (which I copied from one of the submissions from CodeChef itself) and the code was accepted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I the only one facing this problem? And if there really is a problem then why hasn't it been rectified yet? It is frustrating to be hung up on a question with no useful information as to what is wrong with the code. Admins kindly respond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I do not intend to reveal any information about the ongoing contest through this question. If you still feel its misconduct, please delete the question. &lt;/p&gt;</description><atom:link href="https://discuss.codechef.com/questions/31341/problem-with-december-challenge-test-data" rel="self"></atom:link><language>en</language><lastBuildDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2013 03:23:43 +0530</lastBuildDate><item><title>Answer by utsav_deep</title><link>https://discuss.codechef.com/questions/31341/problem-with-december-challenge-test-data/31384</link><description>&lt;p&gt;have u closed the objects of BufferedReader, InputReader (or any other class u might be using) ??
