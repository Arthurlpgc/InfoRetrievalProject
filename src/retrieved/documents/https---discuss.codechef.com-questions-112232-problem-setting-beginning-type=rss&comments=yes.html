However I don't know how to generate such big test cases which appear in problems and also the corner cases . Is there a method/tool for it ? The test cases I generate are not upto the mark of the quality here .&lt;/p&gt;</description><atom:link href="https://discuss.codechef.com/questions/112232/problem-setting-beginning" rel="self"></atom:link><language>en</language><lastBuildDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2017 18:29:39 +0530</lastBuildDate><item><title>Answer by raj79</title><link>https://discuss.codechef.com/questions/112232/problem-setting-beginning/112297</link><description>&lt;p&gt;when u set a problem , its the same as solving , just when you solve a problem , you think of cases where the solution can possibly fail, same is done while setting a problem , those are the test cases where people's code can fail . 
and for bigger test cases just use rand() function, this will help .
but for cases where you expect a user to fail , think as a problem solver for solving it , then only you can think of the test cases where others can also fail.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">raj79</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2017 18:29:39 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://discuss.codechef.com/questions/112232/problem-setting-beginning/112297</guid></item><item><title>Answer by dishant_18</title><link>https://discuss.codechef.com/questions/112232/problem-setting-beginning/112276</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For generating test cases you need to use random function! Check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/likecs/COOK86"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/users/93307/likecs"&gt;@likecs&lt;/a&gt; posted his test generator programs. You can probably learn a lot from them if you are new to these things(as me :p) . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.: You have to figure out corner test cases yourself though! &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">dishant_18</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2017 00:39:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://discuss.codechef.com/questions/112232/problem-setting-beginning/112276</guid></item><item><title>Answer by vijju123</title><link>https://discuss.codechef.com/questions/112232/problem-setting-beginning/112236</link><description>&lt;p&gt;They write code to generate larger test cases. For corner cases, you need to know the problem in detail, and various possible wrong/brute-force approaches. Then, for each approach, you make a special case to fail it. Problem setting and testing takes a LOT of time. Its not something done in 1-2 days.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">vijju123</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2017 17:55:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://discuss.codechef.com/questions/112232/problem-setting-beginning/112236</guid></item></channel></rss>
