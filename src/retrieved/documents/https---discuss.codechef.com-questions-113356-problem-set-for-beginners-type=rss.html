One person pointed it out but the thread got lost .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to point out that &lt;strong&gt;CodeChef Certified Data Structure &amp;amp; Algorithms Programme (CCDSAP)&lt;/strong&gt; has a prepare section in which codechef has provided preparation links to learn concepts and practice problems . It will be of great help to everyone starting new and also those who want to hone their skills .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also has &lt;strong&gt;advanced&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;expert&lt;/strong&gt; sections too each with their own useful links to learn and practice . It will be a lot of help for a lot of us .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link&lt;/strong&gt; : &lt;a href="https://www.codechef.com/certification/prepare"&gt;https://www.codechef.com/certification/prepare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><atom:link href="https://ico.discuss.codechef.com/questions/113356/problem-set-for-beginners" rel="self"></atom:link><language>en</language><lastBuildDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2017 22:57:58 -0000</lastBuildDate></channel></rss>
