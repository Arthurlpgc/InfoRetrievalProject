						<p dir="ltr">With a New Year, come many things “New.” You have aspirations, expectations, and resolutions for the year ahead. Determined and focused you are ready to take on the world. It goes for the programming fanatics as well. For programmers looking to solidify their strengths and make a mark on the programming world, it was the beginning of a fresh programming calendar packed with many exciting programming contests to take part in and win. The first in line was our January Challenge 2017, set on the first Friday of 2017.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the aspiring participants waited for the contest to start, we gave them <a href="https://blog.codechef.com/2017/01/03/a-new-year-surprise/">a little New Year surprise</a>, to sweeten the start of the year for them. However, like all sweet things, they were required to work a tad harder for their sweet. And they did work for it. How well, though, we will find out in this look back at the first long challenge of the year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The January Challenge 2017 was coming on close heels of the busy ACM ICPC 2016 – 2017 India regionals. We along with many other ACM ICPC aspirants and some members of our problem setting panel were on the constant move to different regionals across India. And after experiencing the live action at the onsite contests, it was time to experience the same with global participants online.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The course for January Challenge 2017 came from Maksym Bevza, Praveen Dhinwa, Misha Chorniy, Vaibhav Tulsyan, Sidhant Bansal Sergey Nagin, Kevin Atienza, and Satyaki Upadhyay in company with the Istvan Nagi, making a comeback in the role of tester. Alongside them were our translators in Sergey Kulik (Russian), Team VNOI (Vietnamese) &amp; Hu Zecong (Mandarin) and our editorialist Vaibhav Tulsyan. We thank them all for their efforts that they put all through the holiday season to get the contest ready. Like always, with them by our side, we were expectant of a great contest. And even though, not all the problems were served at ones, the participants seemed to enjoy all of them as and when they were served during the course of the contest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The first AC submission of the year 2017 in our monthly contests came from <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/poikniok">poikniok</a> on <a href="https://www.codechef.com/JAN17/problems/CAPIMOVE">CAPIMOVE</a>, who took 13 minutes to get past the problem, the first in the contest was by <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/slowrunner">slowrunner</a> on <a href="https://www.codechef.com/JAN17/problems/CHEFCIRC">CHEFCIRC</a>, but it was a WA. And with that, the tone was set for the contest. As most of the early joiners went for <a href="https://www.codechef.com/JAN17/problems/CAPIMOVE">CAPIMOVE</a>, which was the first to be solved, there were few others who went for <a href="https://www.codechef.com/JAN17/problems/CHEFCIRC">CHEFCIRC</a> and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/JAN17/problems/CATSDOGS">CATSDOGS</a>, but not many got the result they were looking for. The aforementioned three problems gave a smooth start to many users’ first challenge of the year, while for very few it became a source of frustration too. But that’s how the nature of every programming contest is, you win some, you lose some.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We won’t put it on the New Years Eve hangover, but the slow flow of the submissions into the contest gave it away that not many had put their party hats back in the closet. The first 50 submissions into the contest took 40 minutes. The next 50 took another 40. So, in the first hour of the contest, we barely received a tad over 100 submissions, but that didn’t ring any alarms as we were expecting it to be a slow start for the contest and are sure of it to pick up pace as the contest progresses. And that’s exactly what happened.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The contest started with 4 problems to start with and the early birds seemed to be enjoying them, with <a href="https://www.codechef.com/JAN17/problems/CAPIMOVE">Capital Movement</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/JAN17/problems/RESERVOI">Reservior</a>, and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/JAN17/problems/CATSDOGS">Cats and Dogs</a> being the early favorites. As we moved into the contest, the submissions started spreading onto the other problems as well. And with that, the race to the top was on as well. While the submissions table kept getting populated with submissions of different result code, the rank table was still missing some of its familiar names. But the January Challenge 2017 perhaps was not for the familiar names after all. Yes, there were few in <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/ceilks">ceilks</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/ccz181078">ccz181078</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/hellkitsune">hellkitsune</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/rajat1603">rajat1603</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/skyfire">skyfire</a> and others, but it wasn’t about them, this time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The January Challenge 2017 belonged to the comparatively new and unfamiliar names. If truth be told, 4 out of the top 5 names on the rank table are adolescents on CodeChef, with 5 or less contests under their belt. However, that did not have any impact on their performance and approach towards the contest. <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/jobasha">jobasha</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/mirosuaf">mirosuaf</a>, and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/swm_sxt">swm_sxt</a> seemed unmoved by the reputations of the names accompanying them on the rank table and kept going calmly about their business. And even though they were eventually triumphed by <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/ceilks">ceilks</a> and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/ccz181078">ccz181078</a> for the first two slots, they did secure positions in the top five of the first Long Contest of the year.</p>

						<p>It was the last day of the year 2016. The spirits were flying high as people all around the globe dressed up in an impeccable manner for the final party of the year on New Year’s Eve. Good or bad, however, the year 2016 had been, everyone seemed pumped and optimistic about 2017. We too were, and had our little celebration with our December LunchTime 2016.</p>
<p>Set on the last day of the year, our final contest for 2016 had a fun theme attached to it. Be it the names of the problems like <a href="https://www.codechef.com/LTIME43/problems/SUPVIL">Superheroes and villains</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.codechef.com/LTIME43/problems/FLYMODE">Fly height mode</a> or the excited participants to wrap up the year doing what they love doing. Set by Pawel Kacprzak, who also doubled as the editorialist for the contest, the final course of the year was tested contest ready by Misha Chorniy. Accompanying them on the problem setting bench were our contest admin Praveen Dhinwa, our Russian, Mandarin, and Vietnamese translators namely Sergey Kulik, Hu Zecong, and VNOI Team. And then there were us, excited as ever. So, let’s see how the December LunchTime 2016 was.</p>
<p>Set on New Year’s Eve, the December LunchTime 2016, the contest started in typical New Year’s party where everyone is calm and composed at the start, but as the night progresses things starts getting interesting. The first fifty submissions into the contest didn’t create any major ripple to grab the attention of onlookers. Most of the ACs into the first 50 submissions of the contest came from the big guns like <a title="uwi" href="https://www.codechef.com/users/uwi" target="_blank">uwi</a>, <a title="additya1998" href="https://www.codechef.com/users/additya1998" target="_blank">additya1998</a> and many other popular names. All of whom are well versed with our contests and have been on the top of the rank tables on more than one occasions. Furthermore, none of them were a school student, so our wait to see some action from the school students got stretched a tad.</p>
<p>But it was after 30 minutes when things started getting interesting. In and around the 44<sup>th</sup> minute into the contest we were joined by <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/rubabredwan">rubabredwan</a>, <a title="tasmeemreza" href="https://www.codechef.com/users/tasmeemreza" target="_blank">tasmeemreza</a>, and <a title="shivam312" href="https://www.codechef.com/users/shivam312" target="_blank">shivam312</a>. All of them have been on CodeChef enough and none of them had the most fluent of the start to the contest. So, they didn’t catch our attention immediately. However, as we moved into the contest things started heating up. By now we were joined by the seasoned LunchTime campaigners like <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/zscoder">zscoder</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/barenuz">barenuz</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/kmcode">kmcode</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/yylidiw">yylidiw</a> and many others. And when you have familiar names climbing up the rank table, you tend to focus more on them and less on others. We did that too. And we could not have been more wrong.</p>
<p>The sheer perseverance of <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/rubabredwan">rubabredwan</a>, <a title="tasmeemreza" href="https://www.codechef.com/users/tasmeemreza" target="_blank">tasmeemreza</a>, and <a title="shivam312" href="https://www.codechef.com/users/shivam312" target="_blank">shivam312</a> stunned us all as they took over the big guns and paved their way to the top. They had their fair share of tumbles as well. In fact, both <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/rubabredwan">rubabredwan</a> and <a title="tasmeemreza" href="https://www.codechef.com/users/tasmeemreza" target="_blank">tasmeemreza</a> got their first problems wrong in the first attempt. But they got hold of the problems real quick. The final hour of the contest was the most exciting one, as it was only a 20 point difference separating the top two with <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/rubabredwan">rubabredwan</a> and <a title="tasmeemreza" href="https://www.codechef.com/users/tasmeemreza" target="_blank">tasmeemreza</a> tied up on the same score. And we almost fell out of our seats, as it will be the first LunchTime victory for all three and we were all too excited for them.</p>
<p><a title="shivam312" href="https://www.codechef.com/users/shivam312" target="_blank">shivam312</a> seemed to have more calculated approach as he took over 40 minutes to fully solve <a title="SBSWAP" href="https://www.codechef.com/LTIME43/problems/SBSWAP" target="_blank">SBSWAP</a>, while <a title="tasmeemreza" href="https://www.codechef.com/users/tasmeemreza" target="_blank">tasmeemreza</a> was the fastest of the three as he tool minimum submissions to solve the 3 of the 4 problems in the contest. Then there was <a title="rubabredwan" href="https://www.codechef.com/users/rubabredwan" target="_blank">rubabredwan</a>, who fully solved his third problem with just 2 minutes for the contest to get over. All three of them showed great composure and courage in the final few minutes of the contest. But they weren’t alone. There were quite a few other performances as well that caught our attention and to introduce them all to you, let us take you to the rank table.</p>

						<p dir="ltr">When you have a big day tomorrow, you tend to calm down, relax, and just prepare your mind for it. It holds true for many big sportsperson, many big movie stars, and pretty much everyone, except for programmers. Programmers are the most restless creatures on the night before. And after being with, knowing, and interacting with so many programmers over the years, we certainly can assert that. It was not different the night before the first ACM ICPC 2016 India regional was scheduled to take place at <a href="http://icpc.hindustanuniv.ac.in/">Hindustan University</a>. Knowing that most of the top programmers in the country will either be travelling for the onsite event, or will be relaxing at home to compete in the coming ones, we thought it’s an ideal situation for a newcomer to rise and shine. And we could not have been far from the truth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That he is talented and perhaps an emerging legend in the Indian programming world is something we have been hearing about <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/rajat1603">rajat1603</a>. Time and again, he even has proved it in various competitions. From being among the top school teams to come for the <a href="http://snackdown15.codechef.com/scoreboard">SnackDown 2015 Onsite</a> to being one of the few school students to have secured a place in top 5 in our Cook-Offs, he has proven his mettle time and again. And the December Cook-Off 2016 was yet another display of his sheer brilliance. This time though, the setup had changed a tad.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He no longer is a school student, he was competing in his very first ACM ICPC Regional, and just like himself, his counterparts in <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/uwi">uwi</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/yenthanh132">yenthanh132</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/biginnnner">biginnnner</a>, and many others had evolved too. And considering all that, we thought a night before his first ACM ICPC regional he might want to catch a breather and focus his energy on the big day tomorrow. He, on the other hand, had totally different plans. The December Cook-Off 2016 started sharply at 09:30 pm on 18th December 2016 and in the very first minute, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK77/problems/CHEFSETC">CHEFSETC</a> was cracked by, you guessed it, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/rajat1603">rajat1603</a>. One minute is all it took him to crack the first problem of our Cook-Off. If that doesn’t send strong signals to your counterparts, we don’t know what does. And with that, it was on.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Contrary to the blistering start from Rajat, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/uwi">uwi</a> had a slippery start when he got TLE in his first submission on <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK77/problems/CHEFINS">CHEFINS</a>. However, he was quick to recover and bagged his first AC inside the first 8 minutes of the contest as he cracked <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK77/problems/CHEFSETC">CHEFSETC</a>. If truth be told, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK77/problems/CHEFSETC">CHEFSETC</a> was almost solved by everyone who attempted it. Off the first 100 submissions into the contest, 98 were on CHEFSETC, and that made it obvious that it was the easiest problem in the contest. However, getting the easy problem quickly doesn’t win you the Cook-Off. So, it was better for the participants to move on to the other problems as soon as they can, and they did.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rajat grabbed his second in <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK77/problems/CHEFARRB">CHEFARRB</a> in the 8th minute of the contest, while uwi took further 10 minutes to crack the same. By this time, the competition was nicely balanced. But then, uwi decided to revisit <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK77/problems/CHEFINS">CHEFINS</a>, however, nothing changed this time as well, TLE is what he got this time as well. By this time, Rajat had already cracked <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK77/problems/CHEFNUMK">CHEFNUMK</a> and got a significant lead over uwi. With 3 problems to his name inside the first 45 minutes of the contest, Rajat seemed comfortably cruising to the top. However, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK77/problems/CHEFINS">CHEFINS</a> was not easy for him either. It took him more than half an hour to get it right. That’s pretty much the time he needed to crack the first three problems of the contest. But once he got that, with no penalty to his name, it pretty much sealed the deal for him. And a top slot for him into the contest was almost assured, however, there still was a problem unsolved, yet no one had attempted it and with uwi struggling <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK77/problems/CHEFINS">CHEFINS</a> it was highly unlikely that he was going to attempt that one. So we sat back and waited for the final bell to ring and find out whether 4 out of 4 ACs can get Rajat a Cook-Off win, and turns out they could.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With that Rajat had sent a strong signal to all his counterparts competing with him at the ACM ICPC regionals. And he didn’t disappoint at the regionals either. If you were following our ACM ICPC live coverage, you would know what we are talking about. For now, let us quickly take you to the rank table for December Cook-Off 2016 and see who stood where.</p>

						<p dir="ltr">December is a busy month for every programmer around the world, for it is the ACM ICPC season. The regionals take place across the globe and the crème de la crème of the programming world battle it out to secure a coveted place at the ACM ICPC World Finals. It was no different this year as well. As we stepped into December, some of the regionals across the world had just concluded and we were just weeks away from the ACM ICPC Indian regionals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With everyone looking for means to put the finishing touches to their ACM ICPC preparations, our December Challenge 2016, was their final big chance to test the waters, before they move towards the final frontier. While, for everyone else, it was the final chance to spend some time with their beloved computers and keyboards, before they step into the festive season and treat themselves with the sugary goodness that every festive season brings with it. It was an interesting setup. So, let’s see how the December Challenge 2016 fared.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The start to the contest was akin to pretty much like any other long contest we have had all through the year. It took <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/saurabhrathi12">saurabhrathi12</a> only 6 minutes to get the first AC of the contest on <a href="https://www.codechef.com/DEC16/problems/ANKTRAIN">ANKTRAIN</a>; it was followed by a couple of more ACs on the same problem. The second problem that saw an AC was <a href="https://www.codechef.com/DEC16/problems/SEAINCR">SEAINCR</a>, soon after <a href="https://www.codechef.com/DEC16/problems/ANKTRAIN">ANKTRAIN</a>. It remained like this for quite some time. The number of participation kept going up in the first half of the contest, while it stagnated in the latter half. And that is when the positions on the rank tables get decided. And it was an interesting looking rank table this time around. And we will tell you why.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When in the final days of the contest, the rank tables are generally occupied by the favorites. It was no different this time, the likes of <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/sumeet_varma">sumeet_varma</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/rajat1603">rajat1603</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/mugurelionut">mugurelionut</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/notimesea">notimesea</a> and many others still shining brightly on the rank tables. However, what was striking this time was the number of consistent performers, occupying the top slots. It’s one of those moments when you see your hard-work finally paying off. And the feeling certainly cannot be described in words. To see the likes of <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/gvaibhav21">gvaibhav21</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/jtnydv25">jtnydv25</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/ccz181078">ccz181078</a>, come through the ranks and stamp their authority on the top slots of the rank table.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was not easy to reach there and it certainly was not going to easy to stay there, especially when the seasoned campaigners have you in their sight. Every submission made now will decide their fate and position into the contest. But it seems that after years of wondering through the rank tables, they had mastered the art of defending their position on the rank table. So, as the fabulists would have it, it was a contest when persistence and grit won over experience. And now, we take a quick tour of the rank tables to meet all the winners from December Challenge 2016.</p>

						<p>Even though we are here in Mumbai a rather tropical part of India with very little to minimum winters, somehow, this final part of the year makes us lazy. As a result we fall behind on putting up some important post contest blogs, not many, but few. And the year 2016 has been no exception. So, we would like to apologize for the missed blog posts and will try to publish all the missing ones, before taking on the posts for year 2017.</p>
<p>These posts will be a tad concise, so if you think we have missed any important event or something worth mentioning, do let us know in the comments section.</p>
<p>We start with the final contest of November, the November LunchTime 2016. With an all Indian problem setting and testing panel featuring Praveen Dhinwa and Animesh Fatehpuria, the November LunchTime 2016 promised some beautiful and delectable problems. And the participants comprehended that, as soon as the contest started.</p>
<p>We knew that the students are coming out of a big festive seasons and are staring at another big one too. What we didn’t know was that, the festive season had hardly made them any lethargic. The contest started at 7:30 pm IST and we got our first AC at 7:33 pm IST on <a title="CHEFSTUD" href="https://www.codechef.com/LTIME42/problems/CHEFSTUD" target="_blank">CHEFSTUD</a>. And it was soon followed by a flurry of AC on <a title="CHEFSTUD" href="https://www.codechef.com/LTIME42/problems/CHEFSTUD" target="_blank">CHEFSTUD</a> and few more on <a title="CHEFSSET" href="https://www.codechef.com/LTIME42/problems/CHEFSSET" target="_blank">CHEFSSET</a>. The plethora of ACs against the two aforementioned problems made the difficulty level of the problems rather apparent. So, the flow of submissions was almost in their direction only, with every now and then, someone trying their hand on the other two.</p>
<p>And while <a title="CHEFSTUD" href="https://www.codechef.com/LTIME42/problems/CHEFSTUD" target="_blank">CHEFSTUD</a> &amp; <a title="CHEFSSET" href="https://www.codechef.com/LTIME42/problems/CHEFSSET" target="_blank">CHEFSSET</a> brought the initial smiles for the participants, it were <a href="https://www.codechef.com/LTIME42/problems/TOMJERGA">TOMJERGA</a> and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/LTIME42/problems/BALANPOL">BALANPOL</a>, which seemed like the deciding factor for who stands where on the rank table. So, let’s head over the rank list and meet the top 20 schools students from our November LunchTime 2016.</p>
<p>We start with the ROW top 10:</p>

						<p>It&#8217;s that time of the year again!<br />
We are ready to start the Indian onsite rounds of the ACM ICPC, with our first round being held at Kharagpur. There are 76 teams competing today for spot(s) at the 2017 ACM ICPC World Finals, which will be held in Rapid City, USA! I&#8217;ll be doing live blogging throughout the contest and I&#8217;ll keep posting interesting facts as they come up. Stay tuned for some exciting action!</p>
<p>There is a slight delay before the start of the contest. The contest is expected to start at <strong>10AM</strong>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s use this opportunity to talk about the top teams participating today. The ones to look out for today are &#8220;Triangulation&#8221; from IIT Roorkee and &#8220;FruitSalad&#8221; from DAIICT. Vaibhav Gosain from Triangulation and Sumeet Varma from FruitSalad are two of the most well known names in the Indian Competitive Programming Community. We also have team &#8220;Shockers&#8221; from IIT Madras with former ICPC World Finalists Sundar Annamalai and Karthik Vishwanathan.</p>
<p><strong>10AM IST</strong> : There is further delay. Contest <strong>will start</strong> start at <strong>10:30</strong>.</p>
<p>Some images of the contest arena :-<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/IUnOHmc.jpg" alt="null" width="250" height="200" /> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/czqEYO8.jpg" alt="null" width="250" height="200" /></p>
<p><strong>10:30AM IST</strong> : The contest has started! A long and arduous wait finally ends!</p>
<p>There are 11 problems in today&#8217;s problem set. In my opinion, this is a high quality problem set, with a lot of interesting problems. The easiest problem in the set is H, and we expect teams to start submitting solutions for it pretty soon. It is intended to be a basic implementation problem.</p>
<p><strong>10:46AM IST</strong> : Phew! We finally get our first submission, and it is Accepted. Team &#8220;HappyTreeFriends&#8221; from IIIT-Delhi have solved <strong>H</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>10:53AM IST</strong> : The AC on <strong>H</strong> has made the teams realize that its&#8217; an easy problem, and now we&#8217;re seeing a flurry of submissions for it.</p>
<p><strong>10:54AM IST</strong> : We have a submission on problem <strong>F</strong> by team &#8220;alwayslast&#8221; from The LNM Institute of Information Technology and it Accepted!</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> is intended to be an easy-medium DP problem. You need to partition an array of <strong>N</strong> integers into <strong>K</strong> disjoint subsets <strong>S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>&#8230;S<sub>K</sub></strong>, such that the sum of the difference between the maximum element in each subset and minimum element in each subset is minimized. Formally, sum {i = 1 to K}{max(S<sub>i</sub>) &#8211; min(S<sub>i</sub>)} should be minimized. Also, size of each subset should be atleast 2. The constraints are such that <strong>O(N * K)</strong> will work. To any experienced competitive programmer, the statement and the constraints will automatically indicate a dynamic programming approach. The key observation to make is that the we can sort the array and work with subarrays instead of subsets. After that, it&#8217;s just figuring out the transitions which is not very hard.</p>
<p><strong>11:04 IST</strong> : &#8220;FruitSalad&#8221; from DAIICT, have solved <strong>2</strong> problems, <strong>F</strong> &amp; <strong>H</strong>. However, they have a penalty on <strong>F</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>11:07 IST</strong> : &#8220;alwayslast&#8221; have solved <strong>H</strong>, and are now on top of the leaderboard!</p>
<p><strong>11:21 IST</strong> : We&#8217;ve had <strong>4</strong> accepted submissions on <strong>F</strong> till now, and about <strong>48</strong> on H!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the next two problems that we expect the teams to solve. They are <strong>C</strong> and <strong>D</strong>. Both have trivial ideas, but require meticulous implementation and have a lot of edge cases. In fact, we expect solutions for <strong>C</strong> to be at least 100-150 lines long. Code for <strong>D</strong> should be shorter, but it is not <strong>trivial</strong> at all.</p>
<p><strong>11:32 IST </strong> : We have 1 AC on both <strong>C</strong> and <strong>D</strong>. <strong>C</strong> has been solved by &#8220;FruitSalad&#8221;, moving them to first place. <strong>D</strong> has been solved by &#8220;triplethreat&#8221; from BITS Goa. Surprisingly, this is the first problem that they have solved!</p>
<p><strong>11:42 IST </strong> : &#8220;FruitSalad&#8221; have solved problem <strong>D</strong> as well. They have solved <strong>4</strong> problems and are comfortably on the top of the leaderboard at the moment.</p>
<p>Seems like most teams will spend the next hour working on implementing <strong>C</strong> and <strong>D</strong>. In the meantime, let&#8217;s talk about problem <strong>E</strong>. Given a graph <strong>G(V, E)</strong>, with no special properties (it might be disconnected as well), and the information that <strong>G</strong> has a dominating set of <strong>ceil(V/3)</strong> vertices, you need to find and print a dominating set with atmost <strong>ceil(2V/3)</strong> vertices. A subset of vertices of <strong>G</strong> is called a dominating set iff every vertex in <strong>G</strong> is either in the subset or is adjacent to a node in the subset. Looks hard doesn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;m going to talk about its solution later.</p>
<p><strong>12:00 IST</strong> : &#8220;FruitSalad&#8221; seems to have solved <strong>E</strong> as well. They&#8217;ve got a <strong>WA</strong>, but it seems like the only thing they&#8217;re missing is a trivial edge case, which should be spotted soon!</p>
<p><strong>12:05 IST</strong> : &#8220;FruitSalad&#8221; gets <strong>E</strong>. They&#8217;ve done 5 problems now. They&#8217;re on a roll!</p>
<p>So, <strong>E</strong> was designed by our very own Praveen Dhinwa. Upon first glance, the problem seems complex : The graph doesn&#8217;t have any special properties, the constraints are high and we know that minimum dominating set is NP complete. Also, it seems like we need some sort of 2-factor approximation of dominating set. Let&#8217;s use a common trick while solving problems : Solve simpler instances. Let&#8217;s make the graph the best kind possible, a tree. What can we do for a tree? Well it&#8217;s simple isn&#8217;t it? We know that trees are bipartite, so we can take any arbitrary bipartition, one of them will be of size &lt;= <strong>(n / 2)</strong> and that will suffice.</p>
<p>Ok, so now let&#8217;s think about a general graph. What do we need to do? The answer is, quite simply, NOTHING! Notice that the dominating set for any spanning tree of <strong>G</strong> will be a dominating set for <strong>G</strong> as well. That&#8217;s it. Problem solved. Stop smirking, you&#8217;ve been <strong>PUNK&#8217;D</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Important Announcement : <a href="https://www.codechef.com/rankings/ACM16KGP">Ranklist</a> is live!</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:30 IST</strong> : After two hours, &#8220;FruitSalad&#8221; sits comfortably in the lead with 5 problems solved. Team &#8220;code_phoenix&#8221; is at 2nd place, with 3 problems.</p>
<p>Team FruitSalad :-<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/u92Nzxc.jpg" alt="null" width="300" height="250" /></p>
<p>It seems like other teams are still stuck coding the implementation problems <strong>C</strong> and <strong>D</strong>. For all of those who&#8217;re wondering why we have such type of problems in the first place, it&#8217;s because the World Finals also gives problem(s) each year which are easy logically but require one to write lengthy code without bugs!</p>
<p>Since it seems like the scoreboard will be a bit static, let&#8217;s talk about the next few problems. Whatever we&#8217;ve done till now was in the &#8220;easy&#8221; wave of problems. Now we&#8217;ll move on to Medium and Medium-Hard. Let&#8217;s discuss <strong>B, K</strong> and <strong>J</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> is a Geometry problem. Given a general quadrilateral (concave/convex) and 2 points <strong>S</strong> and <strong>T</strong> on a 2D Plane, compute the shortest distance needed to reach <strong>T</strong> from <strong>S</strong> without touching the quadrilateral. Again, this is not a terribly hard problem. We need to look at the line joining <strong>S</strong> and <strong>T</strong> and divide our solution into several cases, and take the minimum of all of them. Of course, the answer can also be impossible, such as in the case when <strong>S</strong> is inside the quadrilateral and <strong>T</strong> is outside it. Just like with any geometry problem, this requires careful implementation and consideration of all cases. Our model solution was ~ <strong>90</strong> lines!</p>
<p><strong>1:05 IST</strong> : &#8220;FruitSalad&#8221; have solved <strong>B</strong>. This is gritty stuff. They&#8217;ve now increased their lead to three problems, and are sitting comfortably on top with 6 problems solved!</p>
<p><strong>1:10 IST </strong> : &#8220;Rainbow&#8221; from IIT Hyderabad have solved <strong>K</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> : All participating teams have solved <strong>H</strong>!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about <strong>K</strong> now. Suppose <strong>S</strong> = <strong>(a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, .., a<sub>n</sub>)</strong> is a string, then its &#8216;kth power&#8217; is defined to be the string <strong>S<sup>k</sup> = (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, &#8230; [k times], a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, .. [k times], a<sub>n</sub>, a<sub>n</sub>, .. [k times])</strong> where each character is repeated <strong>k</strong> times. Given strings <strong>T</strong> and <strong>P</strong>, you need to find all substring matchings of <strong>P<sup>k</sup></strong> in <strong>T</strong>, for all <strong>k</strong> ie. Find all occurrences of <strong>P</strong> in <strong>T</strong>, of <strong>P<sup>2</sup></strong> in <strong>T</strong>&#8230; etc. Also, it is guaranteed that <strong>P</strong> has at least <strong>2</strong> different characters in it.</p>
<p>First thing to notice is that the constraints are huge, <strong>10<sup>5</sup></strong>, indicating that their definitely exists a linear or loglinear time solution. Here we describe the crux of one such solution. Note that checking whether <strong>P<sup>k</sup></strong> is in <strong>T</strong> for all <strong>k &gt;= 1</strong> is too slow. The idea is that, along with the <strong>kth power</strong>, there&#8217;s also a way to define the <strong>kth root</strong> of a string <strong>S</strong>, say <strong>S<sup>(1/k)</sup></strong>, with some nice properties. Firstly, counting the occurrences of <strong>P<sup>k</sup></strong> in <strong>T</strong> must be the same as counting the occurrences of <strong>P</strong> in <strong>T<sup>(1/k)</sup></strong>. Secondly, The length of <strong>T<sup>(1/k)</sup></strong> must be <strong>O(|T|/k)</strong>. With this, the overall algorithm becomes <strong>O(|P| + |T|/1 + |T|/2 + |T|/3 + |T|/4 + &#8230;) = O(|P| + |T| log |T|)</strong>. There are quite a few details to successfully defining the <strong>kth root</strong> of a string, but it can be done. This interesting problem was set by Arjun Arul, who also happened to have a linear time solution for the same!</p>
<p><strong>1:52 IST </strong> : The scoreboard looks roughly the same. It seems like &#8220;FruitSalad&#8221; have amassed a sizable lead. With around 90 minutes remaining, something spectacular needs to happen for them to be dethroned!</p>
<p><strong>1:57 IST </strong> : &#8220;FruitSalad&#8221; solves <strong>J</strong>. This is unbelievable. They keep their lead to <strong>3</strong> problems, with &#8220;code_phoenix&#8221; at 2nd place. It seems almost certain now that they will take first place!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about <strong>J</strong> now. It is one of the harder problems in the set. This interesting problem has also been set by Arjun Arul. Here is an abridged version of the problem : You&#8217;re given a directed graph <strong>G(V, E)</strong>, where each edge is either <strong>vital</strong> or <strong>non-vital</strong>. You need to remove minimum number of <strong>non-vital</strong> edges from <strong>G</strong>, such that in the resulting graph, every node has it&#8217;s indegree equal to its outdegree. You should output the minimum number of edges that need to be removed, or print <strong>-1</strong> if a solution doesn&#8217;t exist. Number of vertices in <strong>G</strong> is atmost <strong>100</strong>, and number of edges is atmost <strong>1000</strong>.</p>
<p>This problem, along with its low constraints, hints that the solution has something to do with minimum cost maximum flow routine. Indeed, that is the case. The graph construction for this problem is not apparent at first glance. Intuitively, notice that the quantity (outdegree &#8211; indegree) is important to us, and we want to make it zero for all nodes. We&#8217;ll continue on the solution later.</p>
<p><strong>2:30 IST</strong> : The ranklist has frozen, with &#8220;FruitSalad&#8221; on 1st place with 7 problems solved, &#8220;code_phoenix&#8221; in 2nd place with 4 problems, and &#8220;included&#8221; in 3rd place with 3 problems. This means that from now onwards, we will not be giving you updates about submissions and changes in scoreboard.</p>
<p>Getting back to <strong>J</strong>. The graph construction is as follows. We&#8217;ll have <strong>V + 2</strong> nodes, <strong>V</strong> for the graph, plus a source <strong>S</strong> and a sink <strong>T</strong>. For all nodes <strong>u</strong> which have outdegree &gt; indegree, add an edge from <strong>S</strong> to <strong>u</strong> with capacity (outdegree &#8211; indegree) and cost 0. For all nodes <strong>u</strong> which have outdegree &lt;= indegree, add an edge from <strong>u</strong> to <strong>T</strong> with capacity (indegree &#8211; outDegree) and cost 0. Now for all <strong>non-vital</strong> edges in <strong>E</strong>, add the same edge with capacity 1 and cost 1. The answer is the minimum cost we can obtain while maximizing flow from <strong>S</strong> to <strong>T</strong> in this network. To make sense of this construction, note that each augmenting path reduces the outdegree of the first node, indegree of the last node and both indegree and outdegree for intermediate nodes.</p>

						<p dir="ltr">A lot happened in the month of November, both on national as well as international front. From political changes to the financial transformation, there was just a little too much going on around the world to take your attention elsewhere. Not that we had any plans to. But it’s always good to clear that out. So, we decided to do what we know and sat down for the second last Cook-Off of 2016, the <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK76">November Cook-Off 2016</a>. On the problem setting bench for the contest, we had <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/iscsi">Istavan Nagy</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/kevinsogo">Kevin Charles Atienza</a>, and the contest admin <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/dpraveen">Praveen Dhinwa</a>. Joining our problem setters with their translations were <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/huzecong">Hu Zecong</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/xcwgf666">Sergey Kulik</a>, and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/vnoi">Team VNOI</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We knew that while some of the participants are coming from a long holiday season, some will be looking at one, when we sit for November Cook-off 2016. And in both the conditions, expecting a blistering start to the contest seemed rather unrealistic. So, with no-to-minimum expectations in mind, we welcomed our Cook-Off Sunday. And it worked brilliantly for us.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We had a smooth start to COOK76. However, that was only for us. The contestants, though, seemed to have trouble finding their way around the problems. Of the first 50 submissions that we received, we only had 2 accepted submissions. And while that was shocking, what made it even interesting was the fact that 4 out our 5 problems from the contest had already seen a submission. Not necessarily an accepted one, but a submission nonetheless. The only problem that did not get a submission was <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK76/problems/SELECT">SELECT</a>. The lack of green ticks on the rank table made it hard for the participants to find out the easiest problem and bag it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The first AC of the contest came from <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/watcher">watcher</a> on <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK76/problems/SETELE">SETELE</a> after 10 minutes into the contest; the second one came from <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/chemthan">chemthan</a> on <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK76/problems/SECUBE">SECUBE</a> quickly after the first. However, the two different problems seeing green ticks caused a whole lot of confusion as a lot of submissions started flowing on their directions considering them the easy. However, everyone who tried them could confirm that they were anything but easy. It remained that way for a while and even though the flow of submission was not as smooth as some of our other contests, some activity had begun on the submission table and we were pleased to have it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The real action, though, started after about half an hour into the contest when <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/al13n">al13n</a> and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/uwi">uwi</a> joined the contest almost at the same time. While, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/al13n">al13n</a> cracked <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK76/problems/SEBIHWY">SEBIHWY</a> in his first attempt, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/uwi">uwi</a> got <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK76/problems/SETELE">SETELE</a> as his first. For their second submissions, it seemed as if they exchanged the problems, as <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/uwi">uwi</a> went for <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK76/problems/SEBIHWY">SEBIHWY</a> and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/al13n">al13n</a> went for <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK76/problems/SETELE">SETELE</a>, and there wasn’t a huge difference in the submission times either. There was a difference in the results though. While uwi got his right, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/al13n">al13n</a> had to face RTE. And that’s where the difference started to build up. Joining them in the fight for the top was <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/chemthan">chemthan</a>, one of the earlier submitters into the contest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All that and the slow submission rate made it very clear that the contest isn’t an easy nut to crack. So, slow and steady seemed to be the mantra for success. And to find out who used it to perfection, let us take you through the rank table.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We start with ROW top 10:</p>

						<p dir="ltr">November brings out a gamut of emotions in all of us. While some are happy, for it takes them one step closer to the end of the year, some are sad, for it marks the end of the festive season and takes them back to schools/colleges/work. Whichever of the two aforementioned brackets you belong to, we are with you, so let us get on with November. And why not, not much has changed from October to November. Yes, the temperature has dropped down a few degrees, but the colorful decorations are still on, and you can already see the kids gearing up for Christmas. So, keeping up the festive spirits high, let’s set ourselves up for the final two months of 2016, starting off with <a href="https://www.codechef.com/NOV16">November Challenge 2016</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the temperatures constantly going down, our November Challenge 2016 brought the action indoors for the programming enthusiasts with its problems. On the problem setting panel we had Alexey Ruben, Ke Bi, Vadym Prokopec, Lalit Kundu, Maksym Bevza, Andrii Omelianenko, Roman Kachur, Sergey Nagin, Sergey Kulik, Hasan Jadah, Hu Zecong, Team VNOI &amp; Praveen Dhinwa. Now, keeping the holiday hangover in mind, our problem setters had created the problem set light enough for everyone to have fun, and tough enough to get them ready for the final stages of 2016. So, let’s see how the participants fared in the contest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, whether you are a seasoned campaigner or a rookie just coming through ranks, it’s never easy to hit the ground running after a prolonged holiday season. So, it wasn’t easy for the early joiners of the contest to get it right either. After a long time we were seeing the dreaded red cross of WA dominate the green tick of happiness, especially in the early stages of the contest. Call it the post holiday slack or the well disguised problem set, inside the first half an hour of the contest we had submissions on four of the ten problems into the contest. And not many of them were accepted. However, as the time went on, we started seeing more green ticks and lesser red crosses.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/antoniuk1">antoniuk1</a>, among all the early joiners of the contest had the best start bagging <a href="https://www.codechef.com/NOV16/problems/CHSQR">CHSQR</a> and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/NOV16/problems/CPERM">CPERM</a> with two ACs of his first three submissions. He was soon, overtaken by <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/anta0">anta0</a>, who got the same two problems in two straight ACs. But his lead did not last long, as <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/antoniuk1">antoniuk1</a> struck back with an AC on <a href="https://www.codechef.com/NOV16/problems/GIFTCHEF">GIFTCHEF</a>. With the scarcity of green ticks on the rank table, it was the fight between these two that gave the contest an exciting start. And unaware of what was to follow, we enjoyed this early battle to the fullest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The scene on the second day of the contest was pretty much the same, except for the difference that <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/ceilks">ceilks</a> had announced his arrival with a barrage of submissions on the challenge problem <a href="https://www.codechef.com/NOV16/problems/SEAWCU">SEAWCU</a>. Now, when someone goes straight after the big fish, you are bound to question their intent. However, this time around <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/ceilks">ceilks</a> had made it pretty clear, and who are we to question his intentions. One after another, the ACs started following and before we could react, he already had solved 7 and was closing in on the eighth. And he was in no hurry to finish the contest either. He took his sweet time to play around with the problems before bagging them. <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/acyume">acyume</a> though, did seem to be in a hurry, or at least that is what we inferred after he solved 5 problems in 5 straight submissions. He was finally stopped by <a href="https://www.codechef.com/NOV16/problems/KIRMEME">KIRMEME</a>, which eventually became his 6th, but not before keeping him busy for quite a good amount of time. After seeing these performances, we got the feeling that, one of them very well could take home the November Challenge 2016, unless we have a surprise rise. And eventually there were no surprises and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/ceilks">ceilks</a> was crowned the winner of November Challenge 2016 with a score of perfect 1000.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A big round of applauds for him. Now, let’s meet his counterparts at various positions on the rank table:</p>
<p dir="ltr">We start with the top 10 participants from ROW:</p>
<p dir="ltr">

						<p dir="ltr">There still was a week to go for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali">Diwali</a>, but the celebrations had already begun here at CodeChef headquarters. And rightfully so, after all, we were hosting <a href="https://www.codechef.com/ACMIND16">ACM-ICPC India Regionals, Online Preliminary Round 2016</a> on Saturday, 22nd October, 2016, followed by the <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK75">October Mega Cook-Off 2016</a> on Sunday, 23rd October, 2016. We were thrilled, and if truth be told, a tad nervous too. Both of the contests had huge significance for different reasons and we wanted to get it right. So, with jittery eyes and a lot of butterflies in our stomach, we welcomed perhaps the most action-packed weekend of the year for us. And we could not be happier to say that, it just made our festive season even sweeter. You know it; you were there, weren’t you?</p>
<p dir="ltr">While, the <a href="https://www.codechef.com/ACMIND16">ACM-ICPC India Regionals, Online Preliminary Round 2016</a> was an exciting tale on its own, we are here to tell you the story of <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK75">October Mega Cook-Off 2016</a>, which was pretty interesting on its own. Set by Lalit Kundu &amp; tested by Kamil Debowski, the <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK75">October Mega Cook-Off 2016</a> had a perfect blend of festive sweetness &amp; thrill, which seemed to be the flavor of the season. The problem set based on the adventures of Serlock Holmes&amp; Dr. Watson made them even more intriguing. And as the contest started, he participants grabbed their detective hats and were ready for the adventure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The first mystery the users cracked was “<a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK75/problems/PERMEXIS">Watson asks Does Permutation Exist</a>”, which didn’t trouble the users much and was solved under 2 mins by <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/rohanrtiwari">rohanrtiwari</a>. Rohan was then followed by many others and except for a couple of instances, most of them got it right in the first attempt only. And with that our COOK75 was off to a smooth start. While <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK75/problems/PERMEXIS">Watson asks Does Permutation Exist</a>, was everyone’s first choice, because of the constantly increased AC submissions on it, we also had few submissions here and there on problems <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK75/problems/BOOKCHEF">BOOKCHEF</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK75/problems/UGLYF">UGLYF</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK75/problems/COUNTWAY">COUNTWAY</a>, and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK75/problems/SWINDOW">SWINDOW</a> too, however, not many of them were AC though. And slowly it became even clearer that these problems are going to decide the fate and the winner of the contest. So, we waited and watched.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the rank table, it was a Japanese domination with <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/anta0">anta0</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/natsugiri">natsugiri</a>, and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/uwi">uwi</a> occupying 3 of the top 5 slots. And while we had the feeling that one of these three will take home the COOK75, we could not write off the likes of <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/chemthan">chemthan</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/biginnnner">biginnnner</a>, and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/sumeet_varma">sumeet_varma</a> before the contest ended. It all made the final minutes of the contest even more interesting. And to tell you the final outcome of the contest and to announce the winners, let us take you to the rank table:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Drum rolls!</p>
<p dir="ltr">We start with the ROW top 10:</p>

<p dir="ltr">Now, for the final segment of the post, let us take you to the editorials for the October Cook-Off 2016. Penned by the problem setter, Lalit himself these editorials will give you the exact approach that the problem setter would have applied towards each of the problems. Even if you have gone through them, it would be good to have a look at them once more. So, here they are for you:</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://discuss.codechef.com/tags/cook75">Editorials – October Cook-Off 2016</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">And with that, it’s time to say farewell. As the winter takes over, it’s time to wrap yourself in your cozy blanket, grab your cuppa hot coffee, and enjoy some sizzling programming contest. So, you take care of the former two and we take care of the final one.</p>

						<p dir="ltr">As we enter the final months of the year, the excitement levels go beyond the roofs. Whether it’s the excitement of the impending festival season or if you are a programmer, the excitement of the ACM ICPC season, it’s just tough to stay calm and normal during these few months. And finally, there’s excitement to bid adieu another year on a high. So, whatever it is that you are looking forward to and whatever it is that is keeping you excited, we are very happy for you. We are a sweet tooth, so we will be honest with you; we are more excited about the sweets than the festivals. So, whatever it is that you are celebrating in the coming few months, do share the sweetness with us. For now, we have the sweets from the recently concluded October Challenge 2016 for you, so let us share them with you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">First, let’s meet the chefs responsible for the sweets that you devoured during the contest, say hello to Alexey Zayakin, who also doubled as the problem tester for the contest, Dmytro Berezin, Maksym Bevza, Sergey Nagin &amp; Vasia Antoniuk. A big round of applauds for our problem setters. Accompanying them on the problem setting bench were Sergey Kulik (Russian), Team VNOI (Vietnamese) &amp; Hu Zecong (Mandarin) as translators, and of course, the contest admin Praveen Dhinwa. With all those gentlemen having enough contests setting experience under their belt, we knew we are in safe hands. And even though, there were minor queries and questions during the contest, overall we had smooth 10 days of programming action from 7th to 17th of October, 2016.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With problem setters ready with the problems and we ready with the platform, it was now up to you, the participants to come and get the party going. And that’s exactly what happened when the clock struck 3 pm IST on 7th of October. It took only 2 minutes for <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/anta0">anta0</a> to crack <a href="https://www.codechef.com/OCT16/problems/CHEFKEY">CHEFKEY</a> it was only the second submission into the contest, so it’s safe to say that we were off to a flyer. After that majority of the submissions into the contest were on <a href="https://www.codechef.com/OCT16/problems/CHEFKEY">CHEFKEY</a>, making it easy for the participants to figure out the easy problem. Or so everyone thought. While everyone was busy trying to get past <a href="https://www.codechef.com/OCT16/problems/CHEFKEY">CHEFKEY</a>, few wise men tried their hand on <a href="https://www.codechef.com/OCT16/problems/CHDOGS">CHDOGS</a> and found it rather easy as well. The first one to do so was <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/eonx_32">eonx_32</a>. And as the accuracy levels of both the problems suggest there wasn’t much of a difference in the two in terms of difficulty level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As for the other problems, though, it wasn’t a walk in the part for many who tried them. Right from <a href="https://www.codechef.com/OCT16/problems/FENWITER">Fenwick Iterations</a> to <a href="https://www.codechef.com/OCT16/problems/TREEBAL">Tree Balancing</a>, none of the remaining eight problems in the contest made life easy for the participants, resulting in scarcity of green ticks on the submission table. However, as always there were users who were enjoying the contest to the fullest. Among the ones who enjoyed the most were <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/min_25">min_25</a>, who seem to have developed a taste for long challenges as he has only participated in them. We wonder how he will fare in the Cook-Off’s. What do you think; will he be able to deliver the same performance? Accompanying him on the rank table were few new names, including the likes of <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/ccz181078">ccz181078</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/dukkha">dukkha</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/dario2994">dario2994</a>, and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/philipsweng">philipsweng</a>. It is worth mentioning that it was the debut contest for <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/ccz181078">ccz181078</a> and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/dukkha">dukkha</a>. And going by the debut, we can only expect some incredible performances from them in near future. Just like that, there were many intriguing names adorning the rank tables, so let’s take a walk down the rank table and meet all of them. Shall we?</p>
