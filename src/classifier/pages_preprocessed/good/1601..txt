AntiCAPS Time limit: 0.5 second Memory limit: 64 MB The blonde Angela has a new whim: internet chats. Of course, as any blonde, she
writes her messages using the upper case. You are the moderator of Angela's
favorite chat and you're fed up with her upper-case messages. The problem
is that Angela does not respond to your warnings. You decided to write a simple
antiCAPS corrector, which would make Angela's messages readable. The correction rules are very simple:  Sentences in a message consist of words, spaces and punctuation marks. Words consist of English letters. Sentences end with a full stop, exclamation mark, or question mark. The first word of each sentence must start with a capital letter, and all other
letters of the sentence must be lowercase.  Input You are given Angela's message, which consists of uppercase English letters,
spaces, line breaks and punctuation marks: full stops, commas, dashes, colons, exclamation
and question marks. Total length of message is not exceeding 10000 symbols. Output Output the corrected message. Sample input output HI THERE!
