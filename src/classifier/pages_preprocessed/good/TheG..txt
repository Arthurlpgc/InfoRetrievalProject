The
 game of stacks is played among K players as follows: Initially there 
are N stacks of coins where the i'th stack has X(i) coins. In his turn, 
each player can choose any stack and remove any number of coins ( 
greater than 0 ) from it. The player who is not able to pick any coin 
during his turn will be considered the worst ranked player. The players 
following him will be ranked 2nd worst, 3rd worst, and so on. You have been asked to play first. You have decided to play the game if 
and only if your rank is not bound to be the worst assuming that each 
player plays optimally. You need to output "Play" if your rank is not 
bound to be the worst, and "Not Play" otherwise. Input  The first line contains the number of test cases T, at most 20, 
followed by T test cases. Each test case begins on a new line containing
 the values of N and K, where 1 <= N <= 100,000 and 1 <= K 
<= 100,000. The next line contains N space separated integers X(1), 
X(2),..., X(N) where for each i, 1 <= X(i) <= 100,000,000. Output  For each test case in the input, you need to output "Play" if you 
rank is not bound to be the worst, and "Not Play" otherwise. Print the 
result of each test case on a new line. Example  Input: 2
