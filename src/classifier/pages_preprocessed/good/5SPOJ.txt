Status Ranking                HASHIT - Hash it!    #hash-table  #hashing      Your task is to calculate the result of the hashing process in a table of 101 elements, containing keys that are strings of length at most 15 letters (ASCII codes ' A ',...,' z '). 
Implement the following operations:   find the index of the element defined by the key (ignore, if no such element), insert a new key into the table (ignore insertion of the key that already exists), delete a key from the table (without moving the others),
by marking the position in table as empty (ignore non-existing keys in the table)  When performing find, insert and delete operations define the following function:  integer Hash(string key) , which for a string key = a 1 a n Hash key h key h key a 1 a n n Hash key j 2 j j Input  t [the number of test cases <= 100] n 1 [the number of operations (one per line)[<= 1000] ADD:string [or] DEL:string
[other test cases, without empty lines betwee series] Output For every test case you have to create a new table, insert or delete keys, and write to the output: the number of keys in the table [first line] index:key [sorted by indices] Example Input:

But I'm getting WA... Spoj toolkit is not showing output ("due to some technical issues") for the following test cases: 1 2 ADD    :   xyz ADD :   abc  Please help _/\_  :(         rishi_devan : 2017-05-01 14:40:08   Straightforward !         cake_is_a_lie : 2017-03-06 14:46:25   Not double inserting existing items can become problematic after deletions, so be careful! Cost me a lot of WAs.         vengatesh15 : 2017-02-13 08:47:28   There should be a blank line after every test case .. that cost me 2WA         samnik : 2017-02-12 07:41:58   can anyone help me   working for test cases but still getting WA here is my code  https://ideone.com/8Sv2Z1  Last edit: 2017-02-12 14:39:39         Bartosz : 2016-10-23 13:15:46   Empty string is also considered to be a valid key, and it have to be put on the position 0. It cost me few WAs to realize that.
