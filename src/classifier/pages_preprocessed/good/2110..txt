Remove or Maximize Time limit: 2.0 second Memory limit: 64 MB You have an array of n integers. But n integers is too much for 
you, so you want to remove exactly k integers from them.
You should select these k integers in such a way that bitwise OR of the 
remaining integers would be maximal possible. It’s guaranteed that in any test either k ≤ 7, or all integers in the 
array are not greater than 10 5 . Input The first line contains integers n and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 100; k + 1 ≤ n ≤ 10 5 ). The second line describes the given array as a sequence of n integers. All integers in the array are from 0 to 10 9 . Output Output maximal possible value of bitwise OR of the remaining integers. Samples input output 4 1

binary form and perform the OR operation for each pair of corresponding 
bits. If both bits are 0, then this bit of result is 0, otherwise this bit 
of result is 1.
