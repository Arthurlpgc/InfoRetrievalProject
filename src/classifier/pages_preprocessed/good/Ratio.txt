    URI Online Judge | 1022  TDA Rational  By Neilor Tonin, URI Brazil   Timelimit: 1     You were invited to do a little job for your Mathematic teacher. The job is to read a Mathematic expression in format of two rational numbers (numerator / denominator) and present the result of the operation. Each operand or operator is separated by a blank space. The input sequence (each line) must respect the following format: number, (‘/’ char), number, operation char (‘/’, ‘*’, ‘+’, ‘-‘), number, (‘/’ char), number. The answer must be presented followed by ‘=’ operator and the simplified answer. If the answer can’t be simplified, it must be repeated after a ‘=’ operator.  Considering N1 and D1 as numerator and denominator of the first fraction, follow the orientation about how to do each one of these 4 operations:  Sum: (N1*D2 + N2*D1) / (D1*D2) Subtraction: (N1*D2 - N2*D1) / (D1*D2) Multiplication: (N1*N2) / (D1*D2) Division: (N1/D1) / (N2/D2), that means (N1*D2)/(N2*D1)   Input   The input contains several cases of test. The first value is an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1*10 4 ), indicating the amount of cases of test that must be read. Each case of test contains a rational value X (1 ≤ X ≤ 1000), an operation (-, +, * or /) and another rational value Y (1 ≤ Y ≤ 1000).    Output   The output must be a rational number, followed by a “=“ sign and another rational number, that is the simplification of the first value. In case of the first value can’t be simplified, the same value must be repeated after the ‘=’ sign.       Input Sample  Output Sample       4 1 / 2 + 3 / 4 1 / 2 - 3 / 4 2 / 3 * 6 / 6 1 / 2 / 3 / 4    10/8 = 5/4 -2/8 = -1/4 12/18 = 2/3 4/6 = 2/3
