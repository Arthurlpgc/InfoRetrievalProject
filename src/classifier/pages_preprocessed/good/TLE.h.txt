(partial)   Time limit: 2.0s    Java 4.0s   Python 4.0s    Memory limit: 256M    Java 256M   Python 256M    Authors:  kobortor , d     Problem types  Ad Hoc, Dynamic Programming        From left to right: d , ZQFMGB12 , jlsajfj , EnochPoon and nathanl3 During the last DMOPC, d did great and scored    4   t  h    4^{th}   place! (Only to be beaten by Thornhill of course.) ZQFMGB12 is so happy for d that he decided to throw a LAN party with the entire school. The party is organized into   R  R   rows of seats. Each row has   C  C   seats. Initially, there is one player in each seat. As the event goes on, a person's laptop battery might run dry, which causes them to pack up and go home.  ZQFMGB12 will host   M  M   games. Before each game, a single player's laptop battery runs out and they leave the party. Specifically, before the    i   t  h    i^{th}   game, the player sitting at the    u  i   t  h    u_i^{th}   row and the    v  i   t  h    v_i^{th}   column leaves the party. After this person leaves, ZQFMGB12 needs to choose players to play in the upcoming game, so he chooses a square of seats such that all seats in the square are occupied by a player.  Before each game, ZQFMGB12 wants to know the side length of the greatest square of players he can invite for that game. Can you help him?  Constraints     1  ≤  R  ,  C  ≤  350   1 \le R,C \le 350       1  ≤  M  ≤  R  ⋅  C   1 \le M \le R \cdot C       1  ≤  u  ≤  R  ,  1  ≤  v  ≤  C   1 \le u \le R, 1 \le v \le C    Subtask 1 [20%]     R  ,  C  ≤  10   R,C \leq 10    Subtask 2 [20%]     R  ,  C  ≤  50   R,C \leq 50    Subtask 3 [60%]  No additional constraints.  Input Specification  The first line will contain   R  R   and   C  C   , the number of rows and columns respectively.  The second line will contain   M  M   , the players that will leave throughout the event.  The next   M  M   lines will contain integers   u  u   and   v  v   , indicating that the person at the    u   t  h    u^{th}   row and the    v   t  h    v^{th}   column leaves because his or her battery dies. It is guaranteed that the player sitting at    (  u  ,  v  )   (u,v)   has not already left.  Output Specification  For each of the   M  M   lines, output the side length of the largest square of players that ZQFMGB12 can still invite to his game. If there are no players remaining, print 0 .

The answer / output is the the side length of the square, not the area of the square.  The error has been corrected.              fork us on Github | like us on Facebook | help us translate | terms of service |    Deutsch (de)  English (en)  français (fr)  Română (ro)  Русский (ru)  srpski (latinica) (sr-latn)  Tiếng Việt (vi)  简体中文 (zh-hans)
