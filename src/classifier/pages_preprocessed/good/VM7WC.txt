Sometimes, G's can be contaminated with other alphabetical characters—from old age or from memory issues—and the integrity of the G-string becomes compromised.  Here is a prime G-string, made only of G's:  GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG  Here is a contaminated G-string, with some other characters among the G's:  SKGCGUSGGGGOGGELGG  G-strings may be contaminated to the point that they contain no G's at all!  G-strings are only as good as the longest run of G's in the G-strings. Define the integrity of a G-string as the number of G's that are present in the string. For example, the integrity of the first string, GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG , is   18  18   . The integrity of the second string, SKGCGUSGGGGOGGELGGG , is   11  11   .  We can find the integrity of a substring of a G-string as well. Using zero-based indexing, the substring from positions 0 to 3, inclusive, of the second given G-string is:  SKGC  The integrity of this substring is   1  1   , as there is only one G in the entire substring. Create a program that, when given a G-string and a list of ranges queries, can determine the integrity of the substring within each range.  Input Specification  The input is a single line, containing the G-string to be examined. The length of the G-string is at most    10  5   10^5   characters long and is comprised of only capital letter alphabetical characters.  On the second line is a single positive integer    Q  (  1  ≤  Q  ≤   10  5   )   Q (1 \leq Q \leq 10^5)   , the number of queries the program must process. The next   Q  Q   lines each contain two non-negative integers   i  i   and   j  j   ,    (  0  ≤  i  ,  j  <  N  )   (0 \leq i, j < N)   , where   N  N   is the length of the given G-string.  Output Specification  For each query and on separate lines, print the integrity of the substring between positions   i  i   and   j  j   in the G-string, inclusive, and using zero-based indexing.

Doing some research and learning.            0     mse387  commented on June 3, 2017     Since I obviously shouldn't outline solutions here, and the discussion is drifting off topic, do you mind joining the DMOJ Slack @ https://slack.dmoj.ca/ ?              3     kipply  commented on April 27, 2017     G-String!           0     ceongh  commented on Jan. 19, 2016    TLE  TLE is destroying my brain! Any tips?            0     jeffreyxiao  commented on Jan. 19, 2016    Re: TLE  No regular user can see your submissions since the contest is still ongoing.            0     ceongh  commented on Jan. 21, 2016    Re: Re: TLE  Sure, looking at my submission might help you come up with tips. but giving general information on making programs more efficient or efficient methods are also valuable information to a beginner like me.            0     r3mark  commented on Jan. 21, 2016    Re: Re: Re: TLE  This problem requires knowledge about prefix sum arrays. A quick Google search should be enough to figure out how to solve this.            0     println_hi_  commented on Jan. 16, 2017    Re: Re: Re: Re: TLE  I personally always called them tallies- have I been wrong this whole time?            1     Ninjaclasher  commented on June 1, 2017 ← edited →     I don't really understand how this is a Dynamic Programming question. Isn't this supposed to be Data Structures?                0     LordSparks86  commented on Jan. 15, 2016    SKGCGUSGGGGOGGELGGG has a integrity of 11?  The second string, SKGCGUSGGGGOGGELGG is said to have an integrity of 10, but is it not 11?            0     JeffreyZ  commented on Jan. 15, 2016 ← edited →    Re: SKGCGUSGGGGOGGELGGG has a integrity of 11?  Yes, problem statement fixed. The sample test cases were correct from the beginning.               fork us on Github | like us on Facebook | help us translate | terms of service |    Deutsch (de)  English (en)  français (fr)  Română (ro)  Русский (ru)  srpski (latinica) (sr-latn)  Tiếng Việt (vi)  简体中文 (zh-hans)
