XYZ
 is an International Airline Company. It has flights between different 
cities across the globe but does not have a direct flight for all the 
pairs of cities. Flights are such that, all the cities with an airport 
are reachable by other city either by a direct flight or through other 
cities. Total number of flights is of the order of number of airports.  For the past few years, their statistics are given below:  2005 - 487 flights covering 319 different airports.  2007 - 782 flights covering 549 different airports.  2009 - 1197 flights covering 886 different airports.   They are planning to start a new flight between cities x and y, whose
 cost would be C units for the passengers. They need to calculate the 
percentage decrease in the total minimum cost for all pair of cities. 
So, let say total minimum cost to travel between all pairs of cities is 
initially C1 and after the new flight introduction becomes C2. You need 
to calculate (C1-C2)X100/C1.  Input  First line would give t (number of test cases). Each test case starts with line containing n(number of cities) and f(number of flights) seperated by space. All the cities are numbered as 0,1,2,...,n-1. Next f lines will give, index of two cities(i and j) and the cost of flight(C). Each case ends with a line containing x and y with its cost separated by space. t<=10 n<=1000, f<=2000 C<=30000 units (is always an integer)  Output  For each test case output the percentage decrease rounded off to two decimal places on a separate line.  Example  Input: 2

At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in 
the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and 
discussions related to algorithms , binary search , technicalities like array size and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of computer programming .    Practice Section - A Place to hone your 'Computer Programming Skills'  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our programming contest judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing 
for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move 
up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better 
prepare yourself for the multiple programming challenges that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.    Compete - Monthly Programming Contests and Cook-offs  Here is where you can show off your computer programming skills . Take part in our 10 day long monthly coding contest and the shorter format Cook-off coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our programming contests have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for 
Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.
