A Simple Maximum View as PDF       Submit solution   All submissions   Best submissions    Points: 8   Time limit: 0.2s     Memory limit: 1M     Author:  Xyene     Problem type  Simple Math    Allowed languages  Assembly      Your computer engineering instructor gave you a simple task:  Write a program to find the largest number in a list of   N  N   signed 8-bit integers.   Since you think this is too easy a task for your programming prowess, you've decided to make life more interesting... by computing this simple maximum in assembly. To top things off, you want to show off by also finding the minimum number in the list.  Input Specification  The first line of input will contain the integer   N  N       (  1  ≤  N  ≤  100  )   (1 \le N \le 100)   . The second line of input will contain   N  N   space-separated signed 8-bit integers, representing the list.  Output Specification  The minimum number in the list followed by the maximum, and separated by a space.  Sample Input  5
2 3 9 0 18  Sample Output  0 18  Note  To use libc in NASM, the first line of your program should be ; libc . For all others, it should be ; features: libc .  Language Constraints  Because Assembly (ARM) runs under qemu , it is allocated 0.5s and 4096kb of RAM.

GAS by default uses AT&T syntax, not Intel syntax.
Put this at the start of your submission to use intel syntax.  .intel_syntax noprefix             1     quantum  commented on Feb. 21, 2017 ← edit 3 →    Re: Hint  Such false rumours. GAS supports Intel® syntax perfectly fine. To use that is left as an exercise for the reader.  By the way, your history "edit history") leaves a lot to be desired.            0     root  commented on Feb. 24, 2017    Re: Re: Hint  Was going to ask that when I realized my mistake, unfortunately I can't delete comments, so I improvised a comment to avoid the downvotes. Might consider adding that feature to support comment self-cleanup.             1     Centurion902  commented on Feb. 8, 2017    Whoops  How many of you did this one before realising they were asking for it in assembly?            2     Xyene  commented on Feb. 8, 2017    Re: Whoops  Now that you've solved the problem, go solve it in assembly!            0     root  commented on Sept. 25, 2016    ???  Please make it clear whether these are signed or unsigned. I'll assume unsigned for now.            2     Xyene  commented on Sept. 25, 2016    Re: ???  They are signed, and I've updated the statement to reflect this.               fork us on Github | like us on Facebook | help us translate | terms of service |    Deutsch (de)  English (en)  français (fr)  Română (ro)  Русский (ru)  srpski (latinica) (sr-latn)  Tiếng Việt (vi)  简体中文 (zh-hans)
