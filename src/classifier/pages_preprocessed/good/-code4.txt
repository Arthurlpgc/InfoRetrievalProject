It is supported only ACM-ICPC mode for virtual contests.

Lomsat gelral time limit per test 2 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output You are given a rooted tree with root in vertex 1 . Each vertex is coloured in some colour. Let's call colour c dominating in the subtree of vertex v if there are no other colours that appear in the subtree of vertex v more times than colour c . So it's possible that two or more colours will be dominating in the subtree of some vertex. The subtree of vertex v is the vertex v and all other vertices that contains vertex v in each path to the root. For each vertex v find the sum of all dominating colours in the subtree of vertex v . Input The first line contains integer n ( 1 ≤ n ≤ 10 5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree. The second line contains n integers c i ( 1 ≤ c i ≤ n ), c i — the colour of the i -th vertex. Each of the next n - 1 lines contains two integers x j , y j ( 1 ≤ x j , y j ≤ n ) — the edge of the tree. The first vertex is the root of the tree. Output Print n integers — the sums of dominating colours for each vertex.
