Find the lexicographically least substring with a length of at least   K  K   . A string   S  S   is said to be lexicographically smaller than a string   T  T   if     |   S   |   <   |   T   |    |S| < |T|   and   S  S   is a prefix of   T  T   or     S  k   <   T  k    S_k < T_k   and     S  i   =   T  i    S_i = T_i       (  0  ≤  i  <  k  ,  0  ≤  k  <  min  (   |   S   |   ,   |   T   |   )  )   (0 \le i < k, 0 \le k < \min(|S|, |T|))   . Here,     |   X   |    |X|   denotes the length of the string.  Input  The first line will have the string.  The second line will have   K  K   .  Output  Print the lexicographically least substring of length at least   K  K   .  Sample Input  iloveprogramming
