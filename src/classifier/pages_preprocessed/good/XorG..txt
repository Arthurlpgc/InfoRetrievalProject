Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.  Recently Chef invented a new structure that he has called Xor Grid . It is an infinitely large grid G filled with numbers based on these three rules:    G[1, c] = 1 for all c ≥ 1  G[r, 1] = r for all r ≥ 1  G[r, c] = G[r - 1, c] xor G[r, c - 1] for all r > 1 and c > 1    Now Chef is wondering, what are the xor sums of all the numbers within some specific rectangles of the Xor Grid ?  Note Xor sum refers to successive xor operations on integers. For example, xor sum of integers x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , ..., x n will be (..(( x 1 xor x 2 ) xor x 3 )... xor x n ).  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.  For each test case, the only line of input contains four integers r1 , r2 , c1 and c2 , where (r1, c1) , (r2, c2) denotes the coordinates of top left and bottom right cells of the rectangle.  Output For each test case, output a single integer ― the xor sum of all the numbers within G[r1..r2, c1..c2] . Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 10 000  1 ≤ r1 ≤ r2 ≤ 10 18  1 ≤ c1 ≤ c2 ≤ 10 18     Example  Input: 5

4  Explanation  Example case 1. First row is filled with ones, so our rectangle contains 23 ones and their xor sum is one.  Example case 2. Here we have a rectangle that consists of one cell G[23959042, 1] = 23959042 .  Example case 3. The rectangle contains four numbers: 1 1 2 3 and their xor sum is 1 .

At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in 
the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and 
discussions related to algorithms , binary search , technicalities like array size and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of computer programming .    Practice Section - A Place to hone your 'Computer Programming Skills'  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our programming contest judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing 
for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move 
up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better 
prepare yourself for the multiple programming challenges that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.    Compete - Monthly Programming Contests and Cook-offs  Here is where you can show off your computer programming skills . Take part in our 10 day long monthly coding contest and the shorter format Cook-off coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our programming contests have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for 
Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.
