The Health Minister of India has decided to set up screening centers to 
fight the outbreak of swine flu in 'T' towns, where 'T' is an integer 
which is neither greater than 35 nor less than 3.'S' pairs of these 
towns are connected by direct routes. The Ministry decides to set up 
these centers to ensure that for any town 'T', there will be a screening
 center located either in the town itself or in its adjacent town.Your 
task in this question is to help the Health Minister set up minimum 
number of screening centers as per above mentioned criteria. Input  The first line of input consists of the number of test cases (atleast 1 
and not exceeding 50) followed by a blank line. The next line will 
consist of number of towns 'T' (1<=T<=20) and the total number of 
routes 'S' (0<=S<=[n*(n-1)/2])connecting the towns, seperated by a
 space. Each of the next S lines contains the towns which are connected,
 at one pair per line with each pair separated by space. Your input ends
 with T = 0 and S = 0. The input for the town not connected to any town 
is NOT given. Output  For each input case, print a line reporting the minimum number of 
Screening centers needed. You also have to check for erroneous cases.In 
case any error is detected, just print "error" for that input. Sample Input: 2
