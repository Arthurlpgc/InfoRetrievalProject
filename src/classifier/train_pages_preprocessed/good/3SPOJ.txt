Help him!
Your task is to generate all prime numbers between two given numbers!  Input  The input begins with the number t of test cases in a single line (t<=10). In each of the next t lines there are two numbers m and n (1 <= m <= n <= 1000000000, n-m<=100000) separated by a space.  Output  For every test case print all prime numbers p such that m <= p <= n,
one number per line, test cases separated by an empty line.  Example  Input: 2
1 10
3 5 Output: 2
3
5
7

3
5  Warning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages (though most should be OK if the algorithm is well designed)  Information After cluster change, please consider PRINT as a more challenging problem.
