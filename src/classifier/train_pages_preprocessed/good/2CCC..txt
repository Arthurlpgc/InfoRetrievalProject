(partial)   Time limit: 1.0s     Memory limit: 128M      Problem types  Data Structures, Divide and Conquer      Canadian Computing Competition: 2005 Stage 1, Senior #5  Pinball is an arcade game in which an individual player controls a silver ball by means of flippers, with the objective of accumulating as many points as possible. At the end of each game, the player's score and rank are displayed. The score, an integer between   0  0   and    1   000   000   000   1\,000\,000\,000   , is that achieved by the player in the game just ended. The rank is displayed as "   r  r   of   n  n   ".   n  n   is the total number of games ever played on the machine, and   r  r   is the position of the score for the just-ended game within this set.  More precisely,   r  r   is one greater than the number of games whose score exceeds that of the game just ended.  Input Specification  You are to implement the pinball machine's ranking algorithm. The first line of input contains a positive integer,   t  t   , the total number of games played in the lifetime of the machine.   t  t   lines follow, given the scores of these games, in chronological order.  Output Specification  You are to output the average of the ranks (rounded to two digits after the decimal) that would be displayed on the board.
At least one test case will have    t  ≤  100   t \le 100   . All test cases will have    t  ≤  100   000   t \le 100\,000   .  Sample Input  5
100
200
150
170
50  Sample Output  2.20  Explanation  The pinball screen would display (in turn):  1 of 1
1 of 2
2 of 3
2 of 4
5 of 5  The average rank is    (  1  +  1  +  2  +  2  +  5  )   /   5  =  2.20   (1+1+2+2+5)/5 = 2.20   .

I implemented BST and still got TLE? Is there something faster?            0     ZQFMGB12  commented on Jan. 6, 2017    Re: Still getting TLE?

Help?  According to DMOJ my code is too slow, but I run the test-files from CCC's website and it finishes all of them instantly. Is my approach wrong? I feel like the 1sec time limit is too close to my solution or something.            -4     jeffreyxiao  commented on Jan. 29, 2016    Re: Too slow? Help?  Your solution is $(O(N^2\ log N)$ because insertion into an ArrayList at an arbitrary position is $O(N)$ time            -4     MathBunny  commented on Jan. 30, 2016    Re: Re: Too slow? Help?  Really? Okay thanks a lot!             -14     bobhob314  commented on Jan. 24, 2015    Score  Will the scores be repeated?            -15     Sentient  commented on Jan. 24, 2015    Re: Score  Yes, scores can be repeated; they are not guaranteed to be distinct            -13     lolzballs  commented on March 19, 2015    Re: Re: Score  When they are repeated, is the rank the same, lower or higher?            -14     quantum  commented on March 19, 2015    Re: Re: Re: Score  Look at the italicized line.           -13     FatalEagle  commented on March 19, 2015    Re: Re: Re: Score  More precisely,   r  r   is one greater than the number of games whose score exceeds that of the game just ended.              -11     quantum  commented on Dec. 1, 2014    Partial Points  This problem now have partial points enabled. The test cases have been re-weighted to give reasonable points for different algorithms to solve this problem. All non-AC submissions have been rejudged.           -9     BMP  commented on Nov. 28, 2014    moar time limit  plz            -10     FatalEagle  commented on Nov. 28, 2014    Re: moar time limit  Your program isn't going to pass within a resasonable amount of time. Brute force like you are doing will not pass every problem on the judge. The best solution so far uses 0.057s in the worst case.               fork us on Github | like us on Facebook | help us translate | terms of service |    Deutsch (de)  English (en)  français (fr)  Română (ro)  Русский (ru)  srpski (latinica) (sr-latn)  Tiếng Việt (vi)  简体中文 (zh-hans)
