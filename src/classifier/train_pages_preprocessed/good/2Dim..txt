Given N points in a plane, how many squares can you make from these points?  Input  The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10). Then t test cases follow.  Each test case has the following form:   The first line contains an integer N, the number of points in the given set (4 ≤ N ≤ 555).  Then N lines follow, each line contains two integers X, Y describing coordinates of a point (-55 ≤ X, Y ≤ 55).   Output  For each test case, print in a single line the number of squares that have vertices belong to the given set.  Example  Input: 1

At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in 
the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and 
discussions related to algorithms , binary search , technicalities like array size and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of computer programming .    Practice Section - A Place to hone your 'Computer Programming Skills'  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our programming contest judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing 
for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move 
up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better 
prepare yourself for the multiple programming challenges that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.    Compete - Monthly Programming Contests and Cook-offs  Here is where you can show off your computer programming skills . Take part in our 10 day long monthly coding contest and the shorter format Cook-off coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our programming contests have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for
