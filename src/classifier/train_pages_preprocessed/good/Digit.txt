Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.  Recently Chef learned about Longest Increasing Subsequence . To be precise, he means longest strictly increasing subsequence, when he talks of longest increasing subsequence.  To check his understanding, he took his favorite n -digit number and for each of its n digits, he computed the length of the longest increasing subsequence of
 digits ending with that digit. Then he stored these lengths in an array
 named LIS .  For example, let us say that Chef's favourite 4 -digit number is 1531 , then the LIS array would be [1, 2, 2, 1] . The length of longest increasing subsequence ending at first digit is 1 (the digit 1 itself) and at the second digit is 2 ( [1, 5] ), at third digit is also 2 ( [1, 3] ), and at the 4 th digit is 1 (the digit 1 itself).  Now Chef wants to give you a challenge. He has a valid LIS array with him, and wants you to find any n -digit number having exactly the same LIS array? You are guaranteed that Chef's LIS array is valid, i.e. there exists at least one n -digit number corresponding to the given LIS array.  Input  The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.  For each test case, the first line contains an integer n denoting the number of digits in Chef's favourite number.  The second line will contain n space separated integers denoting LIS array, i.e. LIS 1 , LIS 2 , ..., LIS n .  Output  For each test case, output a single n -digit number (without leading zeroes) having exactly the given LIS array. If there are multiple n -digit numbers satisfying this requirement, any of them will be accepted.  Constraints   1 ≤ T ≤ 30 000  1 ≤ n ≤ 9  It is guaranteed that at least one n -digit number having the given LIS array exists  Example  Input: 5

1730418  Explanation  Example case 1. All one-digit numbers have the same LIS array, so any answer from 0 to 9 will be accepted.  Example cases 2 & 3. For a two digit number we always have LIS 1 = 1 , but the value of LIS 2 depends on whether the first digit is strictly less than the second one. If this is the case (like for number 36 ), LIS 2 = 2 , otherwise (like for numbers 54 or 77 ) the values of LIS 2 is 1 .  Example case 4. This has already been explained in the problem statement.  Example case 5.  7 -digit number 1730418 has LIS array [1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4] :   index  LIS  length    1  1 730418  1    2  17 30418  2    3  1 7 3 0418  2    4  173 0 418  1    5  1 7 3 0 4 18  3    6  173 0 4 1 8  2    7  1 7 3 0 4 1 8  4        Author:  7★ alex_2oo8    Tester:  6★ kingofnumbers    Editorial:  https://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LISDIGIT    Tags:  alex_2oo8 cakewalk constructive cook78 lis    Date Added:  21-01-2017    Time Limit:  3 secs    Source Limit:  50000 Bytes    Languages:  ADA, ASM, BASH, BF, C, C99 strict, CAML, CLOJ,

At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in 
the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and 
discussions related to algorithms , binary search , technicalities like array size and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for programming competitions , CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of computer programming .    Practice Section - A Place to hone your 'Computer Programming Skills'  Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our programming contest judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing 
for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move 
up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better 
prepare yourself for the multiple programming challenges that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.    Compete - Monthly Programming Contests and Cook-offs  Here is where you can show off your computer programming skills . Take part in our 10 day long monthly coding contest and the shorter format Cook-off coding contest . Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our programming contests have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for 
Global Community) and lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.
