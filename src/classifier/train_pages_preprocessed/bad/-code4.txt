} The above code seems to be stuck in compiling on g++ with c++11 under linux. (compiled as g++ -o prog prog.cpp -std=c++11) It's been tested and has failed under   Linux 4.0.6-1-ARCH x86_64 GNU/Linux — g++ (GCC) 5.1.0  Linux 4.3.3-1-ARCH x86_64 GNU/Linux — g++ (GCC) 5.3.0  Linux 3.19.0-21-generic x86_64 GNU/Linux — g++ (GCC) 5.3.0  It also fails when submitted to ideone.com, codeforces.com ( eg ), dmoj.ca  It appears to compile successfully using clang++ and when using cygwin Could other people try compile this and see what results they get?

I was able to successfuly ping google.com but i had 100% packet loss to facebook D:. I screenshoted everything to document what was happening and with just a minute left on the timer it started responding again! I tried downloading the input but I watched as it completely failed to download in time due to an extremely slow connection D:. I submitted a feedback request asking for help and sent my code+the screenshots as proof and it appeared I would be recieving a manual judgement! :D Soon after the contest though I recieved the judgement that my soln was incorrect on a few cases D: After correct code was accessible I compared my output to Gleb's to find my bug but my soln gave the same results (withing 2e-6) so I also compared to Anta's output with the same result. :S I sent off another email explaining this and a while ago recieved a response stating that there was a mistake in the manual judgement and "Sorry for the inconvenience you‘ve gone through. This solution puts you in 10th place overall, so we’ll be inviting you to the onsite finals :)" :D :D :D But unfortunately I am still 17 (I hadn't realised they were unaware of this) and so cannot attend this year D: Overall quite the rollercoaster :D Read more »      hacker cup                     +215                  izrak     3 years ago     13               Codeforces (c) Copyright 2010-2017 Mike Mirzayanov  The only programming contests Web 2.0 platform  Server time: Sep/12/2017 21:40:56 (c4).
