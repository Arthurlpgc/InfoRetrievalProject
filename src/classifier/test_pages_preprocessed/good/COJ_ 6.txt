A sequence is defined by the following recurrence: Determine X 1000000.  An evil professor has just assigned you the following problem. A sequence is defined by the following recurrence: Determine X 1000000.  An evil professor has just assigned you the following problem. A sequence is defined by the following recurrence: Determine X 1000000.       Input specification    Input consists of a number of lines, each containing one integer, a value of i , no less than zero and no greater than one million. Input is followed by a single line containing the integer -1. This last line is not a value of i and should not be processed.    Input consists of a number of lines, each containing one integer, a value of i , no less than zero and no greater than one million. Input is followed by a single line containing the integer -1. This last line is not a value of i and should not be processed.    Input consists of a number of lines, each containing one integer, a value of i , no less than zero and no greater than one million. Input is followed by a single line containing the integer -1. This last line is not a value of i and should not be processed.        Output specification    For each value of i in the input (but not the final -1), output the corresponding value of X i mod 1000000 .    For each value of i in the input (but not the final -1), output the corresponding value of X i mod 1000000 .    Input consists of a number of lines, each containing one integer, a value of i , no less than zero and no greater than one million. Input is followed by a single line containing the integer -1. This last line is not a value of i and should not be processed.
