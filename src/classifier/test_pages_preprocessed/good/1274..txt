Fractional Arithmetic Time limit: 1.0 second Memory limit: 64 MB Your task is to write a program, which implements addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations on fractions. 
Input and output fraction format is as follows:  the sign of a number (must be written only if its absence may lead to misrepresentation of the number),  the integer part of a number (the integer part that equals zero must be omitted if the numerator and the denominator are present),  a space character (must be omitted if the integer or fractional part is absent),  the numerator (if it is not equal to zero),  the “/” sign (written only if there is a numerator),  the denominator (must be omitted if there is no numerator),  the denominator cannot be equal to zero.  Samples of fractional number representation: “-7 3/4”, “8 1/2”, “-7/11”, “0”, “11”. Limitations All limitations apply for both input and output data.
The sign of a fraction: if the fraction is positive, the sign is not written; if the fraction is negative, the “-” sign must be present.
The integer part and the numerator may have values ranging from 0 to 30000, the denominator may have values from 1 to 30000.
The operation sign may be one of the four possible symbols: “+” (addition), “-” (subtraction), “*” (multiplication), “/” (division).
The expression is always correct, so the second operand in the division operation cannot be zero. Input The first line – a fraction (the first operand); The second line – the sign of an operation; The third line – a fraction (the second operand). Both fractions may be reducible. The numerator is always less than the denominator. Output A single line that contains an irreducible proper fraction (result) in the format described above. Sample input output -3 1/6
