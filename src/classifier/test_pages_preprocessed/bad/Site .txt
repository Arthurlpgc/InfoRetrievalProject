Now you can filter the rating of solutions by the programming language From today you can filter the rating of solutions by the programming language. This is especially important if you solve problems in Java or C#, for which the minimum work time of a solution is higher than for example C++. If you have solved the problem in several programming languages​​, then your best solution for each language will be shown in the appropriate filtered rating, and best of all solutions will be shown in the overall ranking. To open the rating of solutions, click on the link at the bottom of the problem statements page. 15.12.2011.

If the result is NOT LESS than the amount of ammunition units left, the robot will “Retreat and Return Fire”. Otherwise, it will act as if following the “Guard” pattern.  Similarly, when the battle-robot “Advances and Returns Fire”, it checks the angle to the most dangerous enemy. If the angle is 10 degrees or more, or there are no enemies, the robot just moves FORWARD or shoots otherwise.

Description from compiler help:   /O1 – optimize for maximum speed, but disable some optimizations which increase code size for a small speed benefit /O2 – optimize for maximum speed (DEFAULT) ICL compiler sometimes makes wrong code with /O2 switch. To prevent wrong verdicts we have changed switches but loose some performance. Some programs will work a little bit slower now. Current compiler’s command line:  For C: icl /GX /TC /Za /O1 /D ONLINE_JUDGE  For C++: icl /GX /TP /Za /O1 /D ONLINE_JUDGE  (See this help page ) © 2000–2017 Timus Online Judge Team .
